4fbaba1982644ef08582f452~Aayla Secura~With an athletic build, an exotic beauty, and blue skin, Aayla Secura stood out among the many faces of the Jedi ranks. A cunning warrior and Jedi Knight during the rise of the Clone Wars, Aayla fought alongside Clone Commander Bly on many exotic battlefields. Having mastered the emotional detachment necessary in the Jedi Order, she always tried to pass on what she had learned to others. Aayla was killed, along with many other Jedi Generals, when her troops turned on her in reaction to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's broadcast of Order 66.~aaylasecura_01_169_39a65af2.jpeg
4fbaba71b591ac541cb163cf~Adi Gallia~Jedi Master Adi Gallia was a member of the Order's High Council during the Clone Wars. She and the other members of that ruling body would convene in a temple high above the Coruscant landscape, deciding important matters of the Jedi. Stern and focused, she would remark upon the more outrageous tactics carried out by Anakin Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi in the course of the war, but would rarely condemn their effective actions. Though not as brash as Anakin, Adi Gallia was known to be an aggressive warrior who had no problem bringing the fight to the enemy.~adigallia_169_8b798f27.jpeg

4fbab170431c4b95e98e2e55~Admiral Coburn~With a stern face, steely glare and unmistakable command presence, Admiral Coburn served at the side of General Plo Koon during the Clone Wars. The taciturn fleet officer measured his words precisely, offering clear commands in a clipped accent. Coburn's rigid military discipline served him well in executing some of the more daring missions under Jedi leadership. He commanded  a four-cruiser task force into the thick of a Separatist fleet cordon over Lola Sayu to facilitate the rescue of a strike team that invaded the Citadel installation. Coburn also led a Jedi light cruiser in extracting prisoners from the Zygerrian slave processing facility on Kadavo, steering the vessel dangerously close to the facility.~admiralcoburn_01_169_8db29cff.jpeg

Nonetheless, a saboteur was able to slip into the clone cadet ranks during a training tour over Vanqor, and cripple the Jedi cruiser Endurance.

4fbab4a5fb2eeb95e98e2e55~Admiral Motti~A young, ambitious Imperial officer from the Outer Rim world of Seswenna, Admiral Motti saw the Death Star as the ultimate power in the universe, and burned to use that power against any who dared challenge the Empire. The commander of the Star Destroyer Steel Talon, he served as one of the Imperial military's Joint Chiefs, becoming an ally of Grand Moff Tarkin's and head of naval operations aboard the Death Star. He died when the battle station was destroyed.~admiralmotti_01_169_f01d2570.jpeg

4fbab6da87cc7c9c67aa0b87~Admiral Piett~An ambitious Imperial officer, Piett rose through the ranks to captain and was assigned to the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Darth Vader's flagship. There, he chafed at having to serve under the foolish, vainglorious Admiral Ozzel.

Miraculously, he survived his time as Vader's underling, but died when a Rebel starfighter destroyed the Executor's command bridge.~admiralpiett_01_169_18014135.jpeg
54923057c3c0c56ff77ce6f4~Admiral Raddus~A gruff Mon Calamari officer, Raddus commands the rebel starfleet before the Battle of Yavin, working to knit a hodgepodge of ships into a military force and arrange the delivery of new capital ships to the Alliance. Raddus has little patience for the rebel council's endless committee meetings. As he sees it, military muscle is the key to defeating the Empire, not stirring speeches.~admiral-raddus-main_33194c80.jpeg
533217f96252273e605aadaa~Admiral Statura~A veteran Resistance officer, Statura fought to liberate his homeworld of Garel from the Empire while he was just a teenager.

In the final days of the Clone Wars, Windu turned to Kolar again, calling on him, Saesee Tiin and Kit Fisto to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Confronted by the Jedi, Palpatine threw off his guise and revealed himself as Darth Sidious. He ignited his crimson-bladed lightsaber and struck down Kolar.~screen_shot_2015-05-26_at_5_9f577251.jpeg

55e99c5b39bafb1eeb02ea4d~Agent Gideon Hask~An orphan from Kuat, Gideon Hask found a family with the Empire. Having honed his combat skills from a young age, he was selected by Admiral Garrick Versio to join the special forces unit Inferno Squad.

525f37b759807df4eadb5f89~Alora~During his reign, the Emperor looked to destroy all opposition to his power. Any Jedi could be a threat to him, so the Inquisitors were tasked with hunting down all Force-sensitive children. Alora, just a baby and strong with the Force, was tracked by the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister on a civilian ship.

52345fc65aba4313b3e5e0a7~Alton Kastle~A journalist for HoloNet News, Alton Kastle was regarded by the Imperial citizens of Lothal as a trustworthy, even comforting source of information.

50551aeec5bf9377c45d63a3~Amda Wabo~Amda Wabo, a male Aqualish, was a weapons manufacturer on Garel during the age of the Empire.

4fbab652c11291c1642afce2~Amis~During the Clone Wars, Amis was one of the brightest students groomed for leadership for the next generation of Mandalore -- a plan complicated by the sudden turmoil that engulfed the neutral planet during the conflict. As a Royal Academy of Government cadet, Amis was the wise-cracker amongst his friends, a good-spirited student who often thought with his stomach. Together with his pals, he helped expose corruption at the highest level of Mandalorian politics, but thwarting a black market conspiracy was child's play compared to the rise of Death Watch.~amis_01_169_0b76a948.jpeg
4fb9731d4feda268f74a05ce~Anakin Skywalker~Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to become one of the most powerful Jedi ever, and was believed by some to be the prophesied Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force.

Following the formation of the Empire, however, he was reassigned to inventory.

Still, Echo proved to be among the bravest clones, integral in the defense of Rishi Station and Tipoca City, and eventually achieved the rank of ARC trooper. Through tragic circumstances, however, he would become something more than a normal clone.~Screen_Shot_2015-04-28_at_1_dc5c7acd.jpeg

He and Echo were later assigned with the difficult mission of freeing Republic prisoners from the daunting Citadel prison installation on Lola Sayu. He and Echo were later part of a mission to free Republic prisoners from the Separatist prison called the Citadel. Echo fell in battle, leaving Fives as Domino Squad's sole survivor.

Ventress fought with twin red-bladed lightsabers, and clashed with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker many times. But her destiny would not lie with the Sith. After Dooku rejected her as his apprentice and tried to kill her, Ventress returned to her roots as a Nightsister, made a living as a bounty hunter, and - in the strangest twist of all - rediscovered the way of the light that she'd rejected long ago as a Jedi Padawan.~Asajj-Ventress_d5ca9413.jpeg

4fbac4bb5f0f4d0b4cdaa6b5~Battle Droid 513~The nomadic Death Watch terrorists from Mandalore kept up their fighting skills by blasting apart dwindling reserves of captured droids.

With Owen, Cliegg's son from a previous union, and Owen's girlfriend Beru Whitesun, the Lars homestead was a tiny island of familial warmth amidst the endless desert wastes. Until tragedy struck...~cliegglars_01_169_c2f0b9cb.jpeg
4fbfb7938d1aa6ac3bcd2913~Clone 99~During the Clone Wars, Clone 99 was a malformed result of the cloning process. Due to his genetic defects and physical limitations, he was considered unfit for combat, and remained behind on Kamino to support the training efforts of his clone "brothers." Though his responsibilities were menial and his job consisted primarily of janitorial duties, he took pride in his work and in his connection to the Republic's noble heroes. Despite (or perhaps because of) his physical shortcomings, Clone 99 was gentle, thoughtful and wise, offering a unique perspective for cadets facing the rigors of military training. During the Separatist invasion of Tipoca City, he assisted a group of clone cadets in their defense of the cloning facility.~clone99_01_169_5d50032c.jpeg
4fbfb7963d8ad6ac3bcd2913~Clone Captain Rex~Clone Captain Rex served the Republic during the Clone Wars, often taking orders from Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. He viewed military service as an honor, and he always completed his mission. Fond of using two blaster pistols at the same time, Rex customized his armor with distinctive blue markings. His loyalty to the Republic and his Jedi Generals was absolute, but even this dedicated veteran soldier found himself plagued by doubts as the Clone Wars claimed more lives and brought ruin to more worlds.~captain-rex-rebelss3_35c07871.jpeg
4fbfb798e6699ef08582f452~Clone Commander Bacara~Clone Commander Bacara (clone designation CC-1138) was the leader of the Galactic Marines, a unit of clone troopers famous for their distinctive armor and relentlessness in combat. Known for his aggressive tactics, Bacara led Republic forces against the Separatists during the Outer Rim Sieges, culminating in the assault on Mygeeto.~clonecommanderbacara_01_169_aa642060.jpeg
4fbfb79bde9181973a5ea3f1~Clone Commander Bly~A veteran of many Clone Wars battles, Clone Commander Bly (clone designation CC-5052) served in the 327th Star Corps on such worlds as Quell, Maridun, and Felucia. Bly developed a close working relationship with Jedi General Aayla Secura, who was always reassured to know the dependable clone trooper had her back.~clonecommanderbly_01_169_7452adc7.jpeg
4fbfb79f597ff1973a5ea3f1~Clone Commander Cody~A natural and practical leader in the clone army, Cody was a good fit for General Kenobi, to whom he was particularly loyal. Cody's keen ability to strategize, combined with his fierce combat style in the heat of battle, earned him the respect of the Jedi, and of his fellow clones as well. He often worked with Captain Rex, with whom he became friends. Cody enjoyed a close relationship with Kenobi, often sharing a tension-busting joke with him during intense moments on the battlefield. When Darth Sidious gave Order 66, however, Cody's loyalty to Kenobi was eclipsed by his clone indoctrination, and he ordered his troops to fire on the Jedi.~clonecommandercody_01_169_f3aa1a91.jpeg
5121f90e82998ba2f3f64337~Clone Commander Doom~A clone commander, Doom served alongside the twin Jedi Masters Tiplar and Tiplee. Doom led a flanking maneuver during the Battle of Ringo Vinda, supported by clone troopers including Fives and Tup. When a seemingly disoriented Tup suddenly shot Tiplar in the back, the momentum of the attack was lost and Anakin Skywalker ordered Doom and his men to retreat.~image_947960d1.jpeg
4fbfb7a28408dec9a549844d~Clone Commander Fox~Commander Fox led the Coruscant Guard, an elite clone trooper unit assigned to serve as peace-keepers on the Galactic Republic capital. Like every other clone trooper in the Guard, Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate. Utterly fearless, he was always the first to lead the charge into battle, even in the most perilous combat situations. His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army.~clonecommanderfox_01_169_703bfe09.jpeg
4fbfb7a5efc45d1d33fa85c5~Clone Commander Gree~Clone Commander Gree, designation 1004, led the Elite Corps of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. He saw deployments on such heated battlefronts as Kashyyyk. Gree himself wore camouflaged armor to better blend into jungle surroundings. Though a faithful commander who carried out the Jedi's orders, Gree was ultimately loyal to the Republic. When Chancellor Palpatine enacted Order 66, Gree understood it was a worst-case scenario contingency -- the Jedi had betrayed the Republic, and were therefore dangerous enemies of the state.~clonecommandergree_01_169_ccbc3da4.jpeg
4fbfb7aa29735c541cb163cf~Clone Commander Jet~Trained in heavy-weapons such as flamethrowers, Clone Commander Jet (clone designation CC-1993) survived a crash landing on Geonosis and pressed the attack on Poggle the Lesser's forces, leading his orange-armored flame troopers through the planet's caverns and helping recapture its droid factories.~clonecommanderjet_01_169_e88dd6fb.jpeg
4fbfb7ce052036c822310fb7~Clone Commander Neyo~Clone Commander Neyo was stationed on Saleucami during the Outer Rim Sieges. While on speeder bike patrol with his Jedi general, Stass Allie, he received Order 66 directly from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The command identified Allie as an enemy of the Republic. Carrying out the order, he stopped his BARC speeder bike, falling in behind the Jedi. He and a wingman opened fire with their speeder-mounted laser cannons, killing Stass Allie and destroying her speeder bike.~clonecommanderneyo_01_169_c4721166.jpeg
4fbfb7d0678636ac3bcd2913~Clone Commander Ponds~CT-411, known as Clone Commander Ponds, served under Jedi Master Mace Windu during the Clone Wars. A veteran of such battlefields as Geonosis, Ryloth, and Malastare, Ponds had an Aurebesh phrase stenciled on the back of his helmet that read, "some guys have all the luck." Unfortunately, Ponds' luck ran out when his flagship, Endurance, was critically damaged by a saboteur and he was taken captive by merciless bounty hunters on Vanqor.~clonecommanderponds_01_169_f0cc9515.jpeg
4fbfb7e959505ef08582f452~Clone Commander Stone~A member of the Coruscant Guard, Clone Commander Stone (clone designation CC-5869) spent long stretches of the Clone Wars far from the front on the Republic's capital world. He was able to make use of his combat skills when pirates attacked his shuttle during a diplomatic mission to Florrum -- though nothing in Stone's training prepared him for taking orders from a Gungan politician.~clonecommanderstone_01_169_5f57c46d.jpeg
5082c33175457bd7704c459a~Clone Commander Thorn~Clone Commander Thorn was a Republic soldier during the Clone Wars who led an escort of Padmé Amidala to Scipio. After nightfall, Thorn detected a coming Separatist assault, and acted fast to warn the Senator. With his Z06 blaster cannon (nicknamed the "Hammer"), he and his troops did what they could to hold off the attack. Battle droids closing in around him, Thorn unleashed a torrent of blaster bolts and a "For the Republic!" battle cry before falling valiantly.~image_9edb7ee6.jpeg
4fbfb7ed0edb8d0b4cdaa6b5~Clone Commander Wolffe~Clone Commander Wolffe (clone designation CC-3636) served under General Plo Koon in the Clone Wars, as commander of the tight-knit unit known as the Wolfpack. A seasoned and battered combatant, Wolffe has witnessed some of the worst the war has to offer. Early in the Clone Wars, he lost his entire command when Master Plo's flagship, Triumphant, was destroyed by the despicable General Grievous. Despite such tragedy, he fights on bravely, proudly brandishing his battle scars and instilling loyalty among his men.~ACW_IA_77349_2a55f9c8.jpeg
51c7f844e6a49a918df293fd~Clone Pilot Odd Ball~A capable clone pilot with experience flying multiple starfighters and attack craft, Odd Ball fought at Teth, Umbara and Coruscant, sometimes flying alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi. He joined the hunt for the escaped Padawan Ahsoka Tano on Coruscant, and was engaged in battle above Utapau when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Order 66, directing all clone forces to turn their weapons on their Jedi Generals.~oddball_9e5f9aa6.jpeg
4fbfbe5de5f7172e9a83f025~Clone Pilot Warthog~A veteran clone pilot of many starfighter engagements, Warthog was highly skilled in combat operations. He was comfortable behind the stick of a V-19 Torrent Interceptor, a Z-95 Headhunter, or a Republic attack gunship. He piloted in the thick of combat alongside commanding officer, General Plo Koon.~warthog_01_169_3bc31322.jpeg
4fbfb6c6657d81973a5ea3f1~Clone Trooper Boil~When trooper Waxer was en route to Ryloth on a mission to liberate its besieged population of Twi'leks, he was at first callously dismissive of their plight. "If we're here to free the tail-heads, the least they can do is get out of our way," he said. But, time spent on the planet with a brave little survivor of a Nabat village opened Boil's eyes. The resourceful girl, Numa, guided Boil and his squadmate Waxer through hidden passageways beneath the village, which proved crucial in freeing hostages held by the Separatists. To honor Numa, Boil had a cartoon illustration of Numa added to his helmet.~acw_ia_20764_2243fe1c.jpeg
4fbfb93a70b2acf90453278f~Clone Trooper Dogma~Fervently loyal to the Galactic Republic, trooper Dogma was one of the newer generation of clone troopers fighting on the frontlines of the Clone Wars. Unlike seasoned veterans like Clone Captain Rex and ARC Trooper Fives, Dogma was more rigid in his thinking, easily -- and eagerly -- submitting to appropriate authority. When clones troopers of the 501st began grousing about General Krell's obstinate and dangerous command style, Dogma jumped to defend their commander. Dogma supported  the general -- and passionately believed in their duty to carry out his orders.~dogma_bcf07ef3.jpeg
4fbfba230c24def08582f452~Clone Trooper Hardcase~"Let me at 'em!" was Hardcase's typical reaction when presented with enemy forces, no matter how overwhelming the odds. Legend has it that his growth chamber sprung a leak during his formation on Kamino, resulting in his characteristic, somewhat aberrant, but nonetheless useful hyperactivity. When the blaster bolts fly, Hardcase loses all sense of self-preservation and returns fire with zeal, determined to wipe out the enemy with repeated sweeps of his rotary laser cannon.~hardcase_36c2eaea.jpeg
4fbfba65a38596ac3bcd2913~Clone Trooper Jesse~The clone troopers of the 501st Legion are a tight-knit bunch, loyal to the end to their Jedi General, Anakin Skywalker. Jesse was a hard-fighting patriot who proudly wore the cog-shaped symbol of the Galactic Republic on his helmet, and as a large tattoo that covered his face.~jesse_677c22e2.jpeg
4fbfbbbee905672e9a83f025~Clone Trooper Kix~Kix served as a  medic in the 501st Legion of clone troopers. He is equipped with medpacs and other first aid equipment to help tend to his fellow squadmates in the thick of battle. Though Kix is dedicated to preserving the life of his fellow brothers, he has no qualms about fighting the enemy. Stencilled across his head is the phrase, "a good droid is a dead one" as testament to his mettle.~kix_fac440b1.jpeg
4fbfbe30c0578d1d33fa85c5~Clone Trooper Tup~A rookie clone trooper in the 501st Legion, Tup acclimated well within the ranks of seasoned veterans. Unlike some of the newer clones, like Dogma, who seemed wound a little too tight, Tup was far more willing to learn from his brothers' experiences. Tup could be distinguished by the teardrop shaped tattoo on his face, and the matching markings on his helmet. He served during the grueling campaign to retake the shadowy planet Umbara, under the command of the fierce General Pong Krell.~tup_1de373c2.jpeg
4fbfbe6f11ce0d0b4cdaa6b5~Clone Trooper Waxer~Waxer served as part of Ghost Company, under the command of Clone Commander Cody during the campaigns to retake Ryloth and Geonosis. Waxer and Boil were often an inseparable pair, and together formed a recon team scouting the abandoned Twi'lek village of Nabat. There, they found a young girl named Numa, the sole survivor of a Separatist assault. Though the hard-edged Boil at first didn't want anything to do with the little girl, Waxer was compassionate and decided to protect her well-being. Numa proved extremely resourceful, guiding Waxer and Boil through underground passages that allowed them to bypass Separatist forces.~waxer_ca041ec3.jpeg
5204bf2e55aa5a7b10304a6c~Clu Lesser~Clu Lesser was a Muun banker. During the Clone Wars, he was leader of the Council of Five, which was the ruling body over the InterGalactic Banking Clan on Scipio. With as much money moving across the galaxy back and forth to bankroll the Clone Wars, naturally those in charge, Lesser included, did everything they could to skim money off the top for themselves. Senator Padme Amidala, with the help of former Senator Rush Clovis (and secretly, the Sith), leads a mission to uncover such corruption of the Core Five. Once his embezzlement is made public, Lesser is put on trial with the rest of his banking Council subordinates, found guilty, and imprisoned.~clu-lesser_ce89b8aa.jpeg
514403c063d18cc7fd278e62~Coleman Trebor~The towering Vurk Coleman Trebor served the Jedi faithfully, winning an appointment to the Jedi Council. At the Battle of Geonosis he came within seconds of ending the Clone Wars at the very beginning, only to fall to a bounty hunter's blaster.~Coleman-trebor_6ac2cde4.jpeg
54927e2393525a91196d302a~Colonel Bandwin Cor~General Merrick may be the inspirational leader of Starfighter Command, but Bandwin Cor oversees day-to-day operations. The colonel works closely with General Dodonna to determine how best to utilize Yavin 4's critically important fighter squadrons. His gift for cool, dispassionate analysis ably complements Merrick's talent for leadership.~colonel-bandwin-cor-main_812b64d1.jpeg
53104cdfbdbdb29be213d10d~Colonel Datoo~Colonel Datoo supervised the primary fire control room of Starkiller Base. A methodical man and First Order true believer, Datoo was aghast when his fellow officers tried to flee the doomed base.~colonel-datoo_da714d5e.jpeg
4fbfb7f0ce0326ac3bcd2913~Colonel Meebur Gascon~Though the clone troopers embodied the war effort of the Galactic Republic against the Separatist Alliance, victory was reliant upon valiant patriots of all shapes and sizes. Meebur Gascon answered the call of duty at the very start of the conflict, and offered his keen analysis as part of Strategic Command since the Battle of Geonosis. The Jedi Council placed Gascon in command of D-Squad's mission to obtain a vital Separatist encryption module. No-nonsense and military-minded with an outsized personality and gruff voice, the diminutive Gascon balked at any suggestion that he was simply a map reader, or that his D-Squad assignment was a result of his tiny size.~colonelmeeburgascon_01_169_afe9d03b.jpeg
50475ce50e082691dbe0c216~Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko~Arrogant and cruel, Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko was an uncompromising Imperial officer stationed on Lothal. He would charge citizens with treason for any kind of anti-Empire sentiment, and was quick to report the Ghost crew of rebels to the Imperial Security Bureau. Aresko supervised Lothal's Imperial Academy, where cadets competed to become Imperial officers and stormtroopers. His repeated failures to apprehend Lothal's rebels eventually cost him his life - the Inquisitor ignited his lightsaber and executed Aresko on orders from Grand Moff Tarkin.~image_69756b08.jpeg
561fb3f7b1309699e7cdf72b~Commander D'Acy~Leia Organa personally recruited Larma D'Acy to join the Resistance after years of service defending the Warlentta system. Knowing the Resistance faces grave peril, D'Acy resolutely supports Vice Admiral Holdo as the fleet's new commander despite the doubts of some aboard the Raddus.~ep8-304724_r_82b9ef9f.jpeg
55e99c3f54de0232d74d2857~Commander Iden Versio~As the commander of Inferno Squad, a special forces unit of elite Imperial soldiers, Iden protects the Empire from potential threats, erases its enemies, and buries its secrets. Her unconventional tactics test the limits of the Empire's rigid protocol, but her success as a leader is undeniable. Daughter of Admiral Garrick Versio, Iden gained a mastery of combat and flight at the Future Imperial Leaders Military Preparatory School on her home world of Vardos.~iden-versio_945333fa.jpeg
518e9a458e398b3cbd2e89a5~Commander Jun Sato~Jun Sato was the by-the-books leader of the Phoenix rebel cell. He was grateful for the assistance of the Ghost crew, who were highly recommended by Fulcrum and Bail Organa, though he hoped they would become more disciplined. After the destruction of his command frigate, he transferred his command to the blockade runner Liberator.~commander-jun-sato-main-image_afc16f9c.jpeg
51ee087e23e10dbc63c8b72f~Constable Zuvio~What's an honorable Kyuzo like Constable Zuvio doing on a lawless planet like Jakku? The tough, taciturn Zuvio is the leader of Niima Outpost's small militia, and keeps a wary yellow eye out for cheats, thieves and others bent on trouble. He is often found guarding Niima's landing field, glowering at any local who strays too close to a visitor's starship.~constable-zuvio_2814b373.jpeg
54a67886066e2028d6952a0d~Controller LT-319~Controller LT-319, outfitted with Lobot-tech headgear, was the lead intelligence officer aboard the Imperial listener ship near Killun Station. Ambitious and scheming, Controller LT-319 was eager to impress Grand Admiral Thrawn, and reprogrammed Chopper in an effort to discover the location of the rebel base. The plan would backfire, however, when Hera Syndulla restored her droid's original programming and reversed the feed, destroying the listener ship and Controller LT-319 in the process.~controller-lt-319_9910e259.jpeg
4fbbd657b6f2472e9a83f025~Count Dooku~Count Dooku was a menacing Sith Lord and central figure in the Clone Wars. Once a Jedi -- trained by Yoda -- he became disillusioned with the Jedi Order and thirsted for greater power. Dooku voluntarily left the light side behind and became Darth Sidious' dark side disciple, taking the secret name Darth Tyranus and leading the Separatist army. Dooku advanced Sidious's secret plot to take over the galaxy, but forgot that betrayal is the nature of the Sith.~Count-Dooku_4f552149.jpeg
53321ee2cdc04855d8d8a519~Crokind Shand~A hard-bitten member of Kanjiklub, Crokind Shand was missing an eye and his right leg, injuries suffered during his career as a pit-fighter. His eyepatch and cybernetic leg - rigged to deliver fierce kicks - offered ample evidence that messing with him would be a potentially fatal mistake.~kanjiklub_69f04fa9.jpeg
514b886da51a70dd92fc828b~Crosshair (Bad Batch)~Cold, quick, and deadly, Crosshair was the no-nonsense warrior of special unit Clone Force 99, also called the Bad Batch. A genetically modified clone, he didn't like working with "regs," or normal clones, but fought alongside Cody and Rex during a secret mission on Anaxes.~Crosshair_e95a84df.jpeg
53063cc154946d559c88413e~Crusher Roodown~A burly Abednedo, Crusher Roodown was once one of the best scavengers on Jakku, but ran afoul of Unkar Plutt, who sent his thugs to cut off Crusher's arms. Roodown then obtained a pair of replacement limbs repurposed from a load-lifter, eking out a living in Niima Outpost by hauling scrap and doing odd jobs.~crusher-roodown_3d9da8d6.jpeg
4fbfb7f6c697d4821c3c0271~Cut Lawquane~A disillusioned clone trooper who saw too many of his fellow brothers die in combat, Cut Lawquane left the service. The deserter attempted to carve a new life for himself as a simple farmer on Saleucami. He wants only to live in peace with his new family, his wife Suu and his children, Jek and Shaeeah. He finds, however, that nowhere is safe from the Clone Wars.~screen_shot_2015-05-26_at_5_96792fa1.jpeg
5172beb3f5e0933516e31308~Dak Ralter~An eager young rebel pilot assigned to Hoth's Echo Base, Dak dreamed of winning glorious victories in the struggle against the Empire. He served as Luke Skywalker's tailgunner during the Battle of Hoth, but things didn't go the way Dak had imagined them: He struggled with a malfunction in fire control, and then was killed by Imperial fire that struck the back of the snowspeeder.~e5d_ia_1559_acf49910.jpeg
525f38b4f60488878bb155bc~Darja~Darja was the grandmother of Alora -- a Force-sensitive baby hunted by the Empire. She knew of the child's gift, and tried desperately to protect Alora when Inquisitors boarded their ship. The dark warriors took the baby from Darja's arms, though Ahsoka Tano and the Ghost crew eventually recovered the possible Jedi-to-be.~darja_8bb5497f.jpeg
501180b9712ec88f74f4ad4b~Darth Bane~An ancient and legendary Sith Lord, it was Darth Bane who saw that the Sith traditions of old were ultimately a dead end. All too often, squabbling Sith in their bid for power upended carefully laid plans. After the Sith were decimated by the Jedi Knights of a thousand years ago, Bane enacted the Sith rule of two: there would be only two active Sith at one time -- a Dark Lord to embody the power, and an apprentice to crave it. These Sith would operate in the shadows, favoring guile and conspiracy to bring down their opponents rather than brute force -- that is, until it was time to rise and subjugate the galaxy.~image_55f96135.jpeg
4fbbd889cbdeb52ac01bb488~Darth Maul~A deadly, agile Sith Lord trained by the evil Darth Sidious, Darth Maul was a formidable warrior and scheming mastermind. He wielded an intimidating double-bladed lightsaber and fought with a menacing ferocity. Though he fell in battle against Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Zabrak from Dathomir would prove to be much harder to destroy than originally believed.~Darth-Maul_632eb5af.jpeg
4fbbda3caa87743e447d0771~Darth Vader~Once a heroic Jedi Knight, Darth Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force, became a Sith Lord, and led the Empire's eradication of the Jedi Order. He remained in service of the Emperor -- the evil Darth Sidious -- for decades, enforcing his Master's will and seeking to crush the fledgling Rebel Alliance. But there was still good in him…~Darth-Vader_6bda9114.jpeg
4fbfb8c561679cf90453278f~Darts D'Nar~A proud Zygerrian, Darts D'Nar longed for the days when Zygerria was once again an influential power in the galaxy. He believed that an alliance with Count Dooku and the Separatists was a step in the path towards rebuilding this former glory, though he was often impatient at the Count's indirect means. To D'Nar, power not flexed is power wasted. With relish, he supervised the conquest of Kiro, and the forced relocation of thousands of Togruta colonists.  A powerfully built Zygerrian, Darts D'Nar was a master of the electro-whip.~dartsdnar_01_169_04b9d61c.jpeg
4fbfb8c7ff6351c1642afce2~Daughter~The Daughter of Mortis is a Force-wielder who aligns herself with the light side of the Force. An enigmatic being of tall stature who can transform into a griffin, she is the selfless counterpoint to her brother, the Son, who has allied himself with the dark side. Together they provide balance to the Force, a balance maintained and channeled through their Father.~daughter_01_169_e42fc3ce.jpeg
4fbfb8cb5d12652ac01bb488~Daultay Dofine~The unctuous captain of the Neimoidian blockade over Naboo, Dofine was an officer in the Trade Federation. Greedy, deceitful and cowardly, Dofine nevertheless had the wherewithal to openly question Darth Sidious' machinations, for which he was verbally reprimanded by the Sith Lord. Despite his insubordination, Dofine remained in command of the blockade's forces. He gave the order to activate the droids on the surface of Naboo. Dofine perished aboard the Droid Control Ship when Naboo starfighter forces destroyed the vessel.~daultaydofine_01_169_c94b9f38.jpeg
4fbfb8cea1ec7ec9a549844d~Dengar~Crude and slovenly, Dengar was nonetheless an effective bounty hunter. While some hunters prided themselves on finesse and style, Dengar preferred firepower and destruction. Despite his scruffy-looking and battered exterior, Dengar thought highly of himself, enough to make blunt passes at shapely females that caught his eye. Despite these obnoxious qualities, Boba Fett enjoyed working with Dengar and held him in high regard due to his proven track record in hunting down prey.~dengar_01_169_18886b62.jpeg
50ab4b5e803df63c43d18787~Depa Billaba~A Chalactan Jedi, Depa Billaba served on the Jedi Council in the final years of the Republic. She witnessed the discovery of Anakin Skywalker, whom Qui-Gon Jinn believed to be the Chosen One, and tried to determine the will of the Force as the galaxy slid into tumult and war. During the Clone Wars Billaba would would take Caleb Dume on as her Padawan, but was unable to finish his training before the dreaded Order 66. Forced into hiding, Caleb took the name "Kanan Jarrus."~image_220cf6a1.jpeg
52b092d2edf9f738cf296f1b~Derek "Hobbie" Klivian~Born on Ralltiir, Derek "Hobbie" Klivian defected to the Rebel Alliance with Biggs Darklighter and flew with Rogue Squadron during the Battle of Hoth. He served as Luke Skywalker's wingman during the defense of Echo Base, ejecting from his snowspeeder just before the craft rammed an AT-AT.~derek-hobbie-klivian_cfe8b405.jpeg
56a3965232ed47ed51dfb618~Derla Pidys~A noted sommelier, Derla Pidys sells wine gathered from a breathtaking range of worlds: Orto Plutonia, Naboo, the Forest Moon of Endor and many others. It's a profession that has brought her into contact with Canto Bight business owners such as Ubailla Gheal, as well as patrons such as the mysterious Grammus sisters.~derla-pidys-db-main_0e48340e.jpeg
4fbfb8d17ef6ac541cb163cf~Derrown~It's easy to misjudge the deadliness of a gasbag. Derrown was a Parwan bounty hunter, an alien species with a lighter-than-air physiology that allowed him to float about on air currents, anchoring himself with four leg-like tentacles and two arms. His buoyancy let him reach heights and vantage points not easily accessible to standard density competitors, but he lacked the speed and control that came with mass. The Parwan biology produces intense electrical fields -- Derrown literally crackled with energy, earning him the grisly moniker the Exterminator. To prevent any ill-effects with his carried explosives, he kept them safe in an insulated bandolier across his shoulders.~acw_ia_94349_a0761dcc.jpeg
5205bf1ba330a9180db481b7~Dex Tiree~Dex Tiree was a human pilot from Onderon who fought with distinction at the Battle of Yavin under the designation "Gold Two." He was Jon "Dutch" Vander's wingman, piloting a Y-Wing with the rest of Gold Squadron in the assault on the Death Star. Sadly, he was the first pilot hit when the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader arrived in his TIE Advanced.~dex-tiree_3efe56ad.jpeg
4fbfb8d58a68643e447d0771~Dexter Jettster~Obi-Wan Kenobi counted on Dexter Jettster, an old friend, to identify a poison dart, and Jettster didn't fail him. The cook correctly recognized the small-tined projectile as a Kamino saberdart. Few have ever heard of the planet Kamino, but Dex not only informed Obi-Wan as to its location (12 parsecs south of the Rishi Maze), but also its inhabitants. Dex warned that the native Kaminoans -- cloners of some repute -- keep to themselves, but are welcoming to those with the credits to spare.~dexterjettster_01_169_09c89b71.jpeg
539ac38954a3234a5af10ad9~Director Orson Krennic~As director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial military, Orson Krennic is obsessed with the completion of the long-delayed Death Star project. A cruel but brilliant man, Krennic has staked his reputation on the delivery of the functional battle station to the Emperor.~orson-krennic_4c6477e2.jpeg

516260f5c6de88af92b71383~Doctor Cornelius Evazan~A grubby, scarred smuggler from Alsakan, Cornelius Evazan was once a promising surgeon, but became notorious for conducting cruel medical experiments. Dr. Evazan tried to bully Luke Skywalker in the Mos Eisley cantina, boasting that he faced a death sentence in 12 systems. The doctor and his pal Ponda Baba assumed the young farmboy would be an easy target, and paid little heed to the old man in dusty robes who'd accompanied young Luke into the bar. That was a fatal mistake: when Evazan hurled Luke aside and pulled his blaster, Obi-Wan Kenobi coolly ignited his lightsaber and cut Evazan down.~dr-evazan-main-image_bf435393.jpeg
4fbfb8da1dc9cbc11256a879~Doctor Gubacher~A researcher and engineer serving the Jedi Council, Doctor Gubacher was tasked with ensuring the droids attached to the Jedi Order were kept in optimum operational condition.

4fbfb8ddd4b70ec9a549844d~Doctor Nuvo Vindi~Dr. Nuvo Vindi, a brilliant but demented Separatist scientist, tried to release the deadly Blue Shadow Virus during the Clone Wars. Working from a secret lab on Naboo, Dr. Vindi plotted a catastrophic outbreak that was foiled when the Republic found a cure before his virus could spread.~doctor_nuvo_vindi_0669ee20.jpeg
52b9a329aa3cd9e044e0a6d5~Dormé~Despite no longer being Naboo's queen, Padmé Amidala retained some royal perks as senator. Among them were her loyal handmaidens - a name that did little justice to the women's training as bodyguards. Padmé's most devoted aide, Dormé, advised the senator on Coruscant and helped look after Naboo's affairs when Padmé retreated to her homeworld with Anakin Skywalker.~dorme-2_dd1590e9.jpeg
50a99aad0d10fb6336fed6a6~Droopy McCool~Droopy McCool played the chindinkalu flute in the Max Rebo Band, an ensemble that performed as Jabba's palace band on Tatooine. A veteran musician, Droopy was used to seedy dives and gigs for unsavory clients. But the depravity he saw in Jabba's court shocked even him.~image_3bfc14aa.jpeg
569fd1eeeccb84df5d7c4f52~Dryden Vos~The public face of the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate, Dryden Vos is a contradiction: a pitiless enforcer known as a gangster of wealth and taste. Vos socializes with the galaxy's elite aboard his lavishly appointed yacht First Light, and enjoys showing off his superb collection of antiquities. His good manners shouldn't be mistaken for weakness, though: he can change from generous host to ruthless killer in a moment.~solo-db-dryden-vos-main-image_4ac071fb.jpeg
55c04c57fbd30fa6d57c698b~DT-F16~A squad commander, death trooper DT-F16 leads with strength and the ability to know when to fight and when to retreat. She suffers no fools and demands the best from those around her.~dt-f16_533058b3.jpeg
4fbfb93daaeefbc11256a879~Duchess Satine Kryze~The leader of Mandalore during the Clone Wars, Duchess Satine of Kalevala was a controversial figure. She longed to move Mandalore beyond its violent past and instituted a government that valued pacifism. Though Mandalore did begin to rebuild under her guidance, the dark shadow of the Clone Wars made the Duchess' goals difficult to achieve.~duchesssatinekryze_01_169_8f214c2b.jpeg
5653754406445ffb02a89d7f~Dume~With the birth name of fallen Jedi Kanan Jarrus, Dume is a large Loth-wolf -- even by the species' own standards. The creature's origin unknown, he communes directly with Padawan learner Ezra Bridger.~rebels-databank-411-dume-main-image_ca9c71a9.jpeg
51fcd8969f8858ca724a9368~Dyro Felldor~Dyro acted as a representative for the Er'Kit people and sought the help of Saponza and his partner in ridding the world of a terrorist sect of a slavery operation on Er'Kit, known as the Blood Dawn. After the campaign and eventual defeat of the Blood Dawn, Felldor relayed his gratitude but offered no alliance with his new associates. Upon return to the world, Saponza and his partner discovered that Dyro had been taking part in a power struggle, and was manipulating both the Alliance and the Empire to serve his greedy purposes.~dyro_background_472e4c4a.jpeg
5423bd315e978290ada5a9d7~Edrio Two Tubes~Edrio Two Tubes is a mercenary pilot who flies alongside his eggmate, Benthic. They share the nickname derived from the breathing apparatus that allows Tognath physiology to process oxygen atmospheres.

With a desire to strike back at the Empire, Edrio and Benthic have allied with Saw Gerrera.~edrio-two-tubes-main_db435be7.jpeg
5244dc32d2a7a8135d0383df~Eesh Fahm~Eesh Fahm was a miner on Ibaar, a world devastated by the Empire. He ran an underground network that sought to help his people, and worked with the rebellion to bring food and supplies past the Imperial blockade.~eesh-fahm_f970ddac.jpeg
4fbfb940728c0c9c67aa0b87~Eeth Koth~Eeth Koth was a member of the Jedi High Council in the final years of the order. From within the polished towers of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the Council governed the actions of the Jedi Knights. Koth was one of the 12 Jedi present when Qui-Gon Jinn presented Anakin Skywalker as the Chosen One to the Council. A determined warrior with a deep, spiritual connection to the Force, Koth resisted torture at the hands of General Grievous during the Clone Wars, and was even able to secretly communicate his location to the Jedi Council. Koth was saved from Separatist clutches by the daring efforts of his fellow Jedi.~Eeth-Koth2_246ea172.jpeg
524d6c3bc9fe94e204d13c27~EG-86~On the surface, a harmless GNK power droid. Underneath, a courier holding secrets vital to the rebellion. EG-86, custodian of important information and data, was sent to rendezvous with Sabine and Ezra of the Ghost crew. While the Mandalorian and Padawan didn't expect a GNK droid, neither would the Empire, making EG-86 a wise choice.~eg-86_c531d3ee.jpeg
533385bad34fbf4d2ead7e41~EGL-21 "Amps" Power Droid~Like his mechanical colleague Geetaw, Amps was an autonomous droid who traded his services to scavengers at Niima Outpost.

52f4e3ebf4c434ce16b313ee~Eighth Brother Inquisitor~Nimble and menacing, the Eighth Brother was a deadly Terrelian Jango Jumper Inquisitor. Dispatched by Darth Vader, he was sent to Malachor to attempt to find and capture Maul, and instead found himself face to face with Ezra Bridger, Kanan Jarrus, and Ahsoka Tano. The Eighth Brother often used his double-bladed, spinning lightsaber to propel himself through the air, making for sneak attacks and quick escapes. This method proved unwise, however, when he jumped off the edge of the Malachor Sith Temple with his damaged lightsaber, and fell to his death.~eighth-brother_968dee8b.jpeg
519492b8c264e7c0a58a3c0c~Elan Sleazebaggano~The aptly named Elan Sleazebaggano made his living selling death sticks to patrons of the Outlander Club and other hot spots in the underlevels of Coruscant.

51ee06543d5c8a6492941243~Ello Asty~The Abednedo pilot Ello Asty was known among his fellow Resistance pilots for his superb abilities behind the stick and occasional trouble remembering that a squadron must act as a team, not a loose collection of individuals. Ello flew with Cobalt Squadron in the early days of the Resistance and was a member of Blue Squadron during the attack on Starkiller Base. Ground fire ripped through his X-wing, ending his life.~ello-asty_2f33541b.jpeg
4fbfb9443655152ac01bb488~Embo~A fearsome bounty hunter of few words, Embo was quick to disable his target, be it by a single trained shot from his bowcaster or a decisive blow from his pan-shaped hat, which could be hurled at an adversary with deadly accuracy. The hat also doubled as a shield when the Kyuzo directly charged his target head-first. A freelance hunter, Embo worked with the likes of Sugi and Boba Fett, loyal only to his faithful anooba, Marrok.~embo_01_169_60b97902.jpeg
4fbc18a8ba7d0b95e98e2e55~Emperor Palpatine / Darth Sidious~Scheming, powerful, and evil to the core, Darth Sidious restored the Sith and destroyed the Jedi Order. Living a double life, Sidious was in fact Palpatine, a Naboo Senator and phantom menace. He slowly manipulated the political system of the Galactic Republic until he was named Supreme Chancellor -- and eventually Emperor -- ruling the galaxy through fear and tyranny.~Emperor-Palpatine_7ac4a10e.jpeg
503d2b72d9df7c3d21b80292~Endente~Endente was a Sugi arms dealer who made a deal to sell a giant kyber crystal with incredible destructive power to Count Dooku.~image_1da9a558.jpeg

52680e59ef7e17d00a10f569~Ephraim Bridger~The father of rebel Ezra, Ephraim Bridger refused to bow to the Empire. He and his wife, Mira, were among the few on Lothal who stood up to Imperial occupation, and they were arrested for their efforts — leading to years away from their child. Even in custody, however, Ephraim and Mira would not surrender their freedom. Inspired by a galvanizing broadcast by their son, they led a revolt in an Imperial prison, sacrificing themselves to save others.~mira-bridger_2b5ea7de.jpeg
54a06f31ef3cceceac219ba7~Erskin Semaj~Mon Mothma's attaché, Erskin Semaj is a loyal and protective servant of the senator turned rebel leader. Often, Mothma is a little too daring for Semaj's liking, but he remains a reliable aide and believer in the fight for freedom.~eskrin-semaj_ff1e7fe7.jpeg
51a766dec253b92e46bf9a2b~EV-9D9~The supervisor of Jabba the Hutt's droid pool, EV-9D9 was a gangly mechanical with a quirk in her programming that made her enjoy tormenting and dismembering other droids. She turned a dank work area in the depths of Jabba's palace into a grim torture chamber.~ev-9d9-2_28db778f.jpeg
5205c141855e32569e61bc4f~EV-A4-D~EV-A4-D was the wisecracking EV-series medical droid employed by General Grievous to patch him up during the Clone Wars. He called the lair of Grievous on the third moon of Vassek his home until Kit Fisto and Nahdar Veb broke into the place in pursuit of Grievous. The two Jedi smashed up the interior and killed Grievous's pet before Kit Fisto located the defenseless droid and decapitated him completely unprovoked.~ev-a4-d_575ca6d8.jpeg
4fbfb94bce54f6ac3bcd2913~Even Piell~A gruff and battle-hardened Jedi as well as senior member of the Jedi council, Even Piell was bigger than life though he was small in stature.

4fbfb952112b8c541cb163cf~Ezra Bridger~Growing up on his own during the age of the Empire, Ezra Bridger relied on his street smarts -- and subconscious Force abilities -- to survive. He became a con artist and small-time thief, doing what he needed to get by on his home planet Lothal. But this reality also hardened Ezra, who by the time he was 14 years old, had little trust for anyone. That would change with his introduction to the Ghost crew, a small band of rebels fighting back against the Empire. Ezra came to believe in their cause, and saw that he could help change the galaxy for the better. And with the help of Kanan Jarrus, he began to learn the ways of the Jedi.~ezra-bridger-s3_2236d8f8.jpeg
4fbfb955707ddc541cb163cf~Father~In the mysterious realm of Mortis there exists a trio of beings able to wield the Force in ways no known mortals of the galaxy can. The Father maintained balance between his Daughter and his Son, who expressed affinity to the light and dark side of the Force, respectively. The Father knew his days were numbered -- facing his impending demise, he needed to find another to keep the balance. His goal was the same described in an ancient Jedi prophecy -- the rise of a Chosen One who will bring balance to the Force.~father_01_169_c0d0b780.jpeg
52a59b7f1cc4fa123599990e~Fenn Rau~Veteran of the Clone Wars and a respected warrior, Fenn Rau led the Protectors of Concord Dawn with a combination of honor and ruthlessness. During the Clone Wars, he served as a flight instructor for the clone army and fought in many clashes, including the Battle of Mygeeto. After the rise of the Empire, however, he accepted payment to act in service of the Imperials. It was not until he met with -- and was captured by -- the Ghost crew's Kanan and Sabine that he came to align with the rebels.~fenn-rau_f1be177c.jpeg
5231a554d8bcf6a864e22345~Fifth Brother Inquisitor ~A big, hulking enforcer, the Fifth Brother Inquisitor was among a group of Inquisitors used by the Empire to hunt down any surviving Jedi. Trained in the dark side of the Force, he wielded the same model dual-bladed lightsaber as the Grand Inquisitor, reveling in the opportunity to destroy rebels and Force-wielders alike. Along with the Seventh Sister, he was dispatched by Darth Vader to locate the Ghost crew and bring them to justice.~fifth-brother-inquisitor_03d7760a.jpeg
5205c57fd41019f27def0395~Figrin D'an~Figrin D'an was the rocking frontman for the all-Bith band "The Modal Nodes." His deft playing of the Kloo Horn for the band earned him the nickname "Fiery" Figrin. Playing their most recognizable tune in the Mos Eisley cantina, they were interrupted briefly when Obi-Wan Kenobi attacked Ponda Boba and Dr. Cornelius Evazan.~figrin-dan_59ce7b09.jpeg
51edc6bbdbb08b92ca6f1401~Finn~FN-2187 was trained since birth to serve the First Order as a stormtrooper, but a skirmish on Jakku awakened his conscience and drove him down a different path, one that proved both heroic and dangerous. He helped Poe Dameron escape the First Order - picking up the nickname Finn in doing so - and then sought his own freedom alongside Rey and BB-8. Finn helped the Resistance destroy Starkiller Base, but had to decide his true loyalties: Would he continue to fight alongside the Resistance's soldiers, or seek to reunite with Rey and flee the galactic conflict? At first Finn tried to flee the war, but a mission alongside Rose Tico convinced him that he had to commit himself to the Resistance's cause.~finn-main_952e10d2.jpeg
52f7270320bbc3585910e237~FN-2199~A stormtrooper raised from birth to serve the First Order, FN-2199 fought alongside his comrades FN-2000, FN-2003 and FN-2187. During combat training he took the nickname Nines. After FN-2187 defected from the First Order, Nines encountered his old squadmate again during the raid on Takodana. Angrily denouncing FN-2187 as a traitor, he tried to subdue his former friend with a Z6 riot baton, but was gunned down by Han Solo.~fn-2199_bfaed44a.jpeg
4fbfb97d22c6bc541cb163cf~Fode and Beed~Flamboyant, colorful and not always too accurate, Fode and Beed were the popular announcers of the Boonta Eve Podrace. The two were well suited for their chosen vocation -- they were a two-headed alien that shared a single body. Fode, whose skin was tinted red, provided commentary in an easy Basic drawl, while Beed, the green-hued head, provided counterpoint in Huttese.~fodeandbeed_01_169_823c43bd.jpeg
5492854ee86f01b97b264822~G2-1B7~A medical droid operating out of Jedha's Catacombs of Cadera, G2-1B7 has one primary mission: keep Saw Gerrera alive. That's no small challenge, as the infamous rebel partisan has lost limbs battling the Empire and inhaled near-lethal doses of Geonosian insecticide. G2-1B7 doses Saw with medicine at dangerously short intervals, and is puzzled that its high-value patient is still alive.~g2-1b7-main_d72ce66a.jpeg
533210bbe5d8ae104526ae2b~GA-97~GA-97 looks much the same as every other servant droid found at Maz's castle on Takodana, but the battered automaton is actually part of the galaxy-wide network of droids secretly serving the Resistance. After spotting BB-8, GA-7 swiftly reported this discovery to C-3PO on D'Qar. Resistance starfighters and troops then raced to Takodana, desperate to beat the First Order to the site of the signal.~ga-97_eb9c3632.jpeg
549151eac6afa7305b68aae9~Galen Erso~A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso was coerced into using kyber crystals to enhance energy yields - work his friend Orson Krennic then weaponized to create the Death Star's superlaser.

50813215fc75608dd3ac568d~Gall Trayvis~Gall Trayvis was a senator-turned-rebel during the reign of the Emperor. He made underground transmissions through the Holonet, reporting real news that the Empire would try to keep secret. For those fighting against Imperial rule, Trayvis' broadcasts were both inspiring and a source of intel. But Trayvis was actually a double agent - his communications with rebel groups were designed to lure them into revealing themselves, after which they'd suffer accidents arranged by the Empire. Lothal's rebels nearly fell into Trayvis's trap, but Hera Syndulla tricked the Imperial agent into disclosing his true loyalties.~Gall-Trayvis_a24a16c1.jpeg
4fbfb97fe836ec541cb163cf~Ganodi~A starry-eyed Rodian girl, Ganodi was a bright student in the Jedi Temple during the Clone Wars. She underwent an important rite of passage called The Gathering, which required her to enter the heart of the Crystal Cave on Ilum, and discover the crystal that was perfectly attuned to her through the Force. This gem would become the heart of her lightsaber, but first, she needed to overcome despair at the overwhelming nature of the challenge before her.~ganodi_01_169_f6cb9dbb.jpeg
5407b69adb2b9d7739db9ef4~Gar Saxon~Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore, Gar Saxon of Clan Vizsla was the ruthless leader of the Imperial Super Commandos -- Mandalorians loyal to the Empire.

51dc5f8d6c7a3b1ba095402c~Gardulla the Hutt~A wily crime lord and member of the shadowy Hutt Council, Gardulla was the original owner of Shmi and Anakin Skywalker, but lost them betting with the junk dealer Watto. She watched her former slave's victory in the Boonta Eve Classic alongside Jabba. Years later, Gardulla and the Council hired Cad Bane to free Ziro the Hutt from a Republic prison, fearing the traitorous Hutt would spill their secrets. When Ziro escaped from Gardulla's palace on Nal Hutta, she hired Bane to track him down.~gardulla-the-hutt-main-image_5f3900ca.jpeg
51855c6314f34acff1662ecf~Garindan~A long-snooted Kubaz, Garindan made a living ferreting out information in Mos Eisley and selling it to the highest bidder. After the Empire hired Garindan and other spies to search for a pair of missing droids, the Kubaz discovered a duo that fit the Imperial description. He followed Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Docking Bay 94 for their rendezvous with Han Solo, then summoned Imperial troops to apprehend them.~garindan-main-image_409cd281.jpeg
4fbfb98267568d1d33fa85c5~Garnac~The ferocious leader of a lodge of Trandhoshan hunters, Garnac savored the thrill of stalking prey through the underbrush of Wasskah. He proudly watched as his son, Dar, took up the hunt, but had not counted on the resilience of their Padawan quarry.~garnac_01_169_054a0fce.jpeg
51892016c169a4cda70313ed~Garven Dreis~A native of the planet Virujansi, Garven "Dave" Dreis flew in the Battle of Yavin as Red Leader. After witnessing the death of his friend Pops Krail and the pilots of Gold Squadron at the hands of Darth Vader, Dreis began his own run at the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, with Luke Skywalker keeping another group of Red Squadron pilots back in case the attempt failed. Dreis survived long enough to fire his proton torpedoes at the battle station's exhaust port, but his shot impacted on the surface instead of entering the port. Vader then gunned Red Leader down.~garven-dreis_efe9195b.jpeg
4fbfb9853e8b9ef08582f452~Gasgano~A slight, spindly, six-limbed alien, Gasgano was a thrill-seeker uniquely suited to the extreme sport of Podracing. Gasgano was very competitive, and sought to beat racers Anakin Skywalker and Sebulba during the Boonta Eve Podrace. He piloted a green Ord Pedrovia Podracer in the competition.~gasgano_6f648f83.jpeg
54923388e0e1b2f3128fed87~General Draven~A veteran of the Clone Wars, Davits Draven represents Alliance Intelligence on the rebel council. With the Alliance too ill-equipped to oppose the Empire directly, Draven and his operatives work in the shadows, waging war through sabotage, infiltration and assassination. Draven makes no apology for his methods, regarding them as necessary responses to the Empire's power and cruelty.~general-draven-main_dc9f0eb2.jpeg
54927f0b500319134073af2b~General Dustil Forell~Dustil Forell is in charge of Support Services for Alliance High Command. It's a thankless task, as the Massassi base has less than a dozen medium freighters and a converted light freighter for transporting materials and personnel. This complement is inadequate, and Forell knows an evacuation would strain these meager resources to the breaking point.~general-dustil-forell-main_05dc6482.jpeg
4fbbe026d4670b95e98e2e55~General Grievous~General Grievous was a brilliant Separatist military strategist and a feared Jedi hunter, known for his ruthlessness and hacking cough. His body itself was a weapon, allowing him lightning quick strikes and devastating blows. But he was also quick to run from a fight, a tactic that worked until one final meeting with Obi-Wan Kenobi.~General-Grievous_c9df9cb5.jpeg
51edc0f70e9baa6492941243~General Hux~A young, ruthless officer in the First Order, General Hux has complete confidence in his troops, training methods and weapons. A rival of Kylo Ren's, Hux eagerly awaits the day when the First Order's technological innovations will help bring down the hated New Republic and the Resistance, and considers it his destiny to rule the galaxy.~general-hux-feature-image_fd5861fa.jpeg
4fbfb98bc4ae8d0b4cdaa6b5~General Kalani~Early in the Clone Wars, the Separatist droid army was often led into war by analytically minded tactical droids. Before long, the Republic was able to outmaneuver the tactical droids by exploiting their reliance on precise calculation and lack of imagination when dealing with the unexpected. Furthermore, the droids were spindly mechanics whose heads could be yanked off and scoured for vital combat data. Super tactical droids, like General Kalani, were an improvement over the standard tactical droid. Kalani's advanced processors and robust frame made him a threat to be reckoned with.~general_kalani_4d7e9be0.jpeg
4fbfb98ef16d26ac3bcd2913~General Madine~General Madine specialized in covert actions for the Rebel Alliance, waging war in secret against Imperial troops and the Emperor's own shadowy agents.

54923261b4fdc1c8aca63b7e~General Merrick~Antoc Merrick commands Yavin 4's starfighters before the Battle of the Death Star, flying as Blue Leader. He joined the Rebellion from the Rarefied Air Cavalry of Virujansi, where he served alongside his friend Garven Dreis, later Red Leader. Merrick knows unit cohesion and cooperation are vital for the Starfighter Corps, and cares deeply for the pilots under his command~general-merrick-main_33a3801c.jpeg
54927a42d59c39595f2e896f~General Pitt Onoran~Pitt Onoran is in charge of Yavin 4's Special Forces division, including the legendary Pathfinders for whom no Alliance mission is too tough or demanding. A Republic veteran, he brings valuable logistics experience to Alliance High Command.~general-pitt-onoran-main_f7311270.jpeg
4fbfb99209e2def08582f452~General Pong Krell~This Besalisk Jedi is all about getting results and, indeed, his battlefield record lists many key victories in the Clone Wars. He has an  unshakable confidence in his methods, and he will brook no insubordination among his charges. In personal combat, he can be ferocious -- his giant arms carry two double-ended lightsabers, making him extremely dangerous in close quarters. Pong Krell's reputation as a successful general is well known but so is the fact that the casualty rates of the clone troopers under his command are the highest.~generalpongkrell_01_169_92dfaeda.jpeg
51891f955e2594d7e588d633~General Rieekan~A battle-weary veteran of the Clone Wars, Carlist Rieekan served the Alliance in its struggle against the Empire, commanding rebel forces on Hoth. Rieekan was a native of Alderaan, and the destruction of his homeworld haunted him. After Han Solo and Chewbacca discovered an Imperial probe droid on Hoth, Rieekan ordered an immediate evacuation of Echo Base. The decision wasn't popular - rebel personnel had barely completed the grueling work of establishing the base -- but Rieekan's caution prevented the Battle of Hoth from being a total rout, and so helped save the Alliance.~general-rieekan_bdcddf69.jpeg
51dc6851de83fec22bc60818~General Tagge~Born into wealth and privilege on Tepasi, General Cassio Tagge served as chief of military operations aboard the first Death Star, though he disdained the battle station as "Tarkin's Folly." Unlike his rival Admiral Motti, Tagge took the threat posed by the Rebel Alliance seriously. Tagge was not aboard the Death Star when it exploded over Yavin; acknowledging that Tagge had been correct about the rebel threat, the Emperor promoted him to Grand General and placed him in charge of the Imperial military.~general-tagge-main-image_d9443d72.jpeg
4fbfb9e30d795c9c67aa0b87~General Tandin~The leader of the royal guard and native military forces of Onderon, General Tandin was a proud patriot devoted to protecting the crown and the sanctity of the Onderonian people. When the planet sided with the Separatists during the Clone Wars, Tandin supported the new king, Sanjay Rash, despite his misgivings of offworld interlopers interfering in Onderonian affairs. The people of Onderon, though, began to reject Rash's rule, and an insurgency began targeting the battle droid forces stationed on the planet. Tandin had difficulty waging war against his own people, and cared little for the military support and tactical advice offered by the emotionless droids sent by the Confederacy to reinforce his defenses.~general_tandin_8026158d.jpeg
4fbfb9e5ef75bec9a549844d~General Tarpals~The gravelly-voiced patrol chief of Otoh Gunga, Tarpals has endured many a headache caused by the antics of Jar Jar Binks. Tarpals kept an eye on the bumbling outcast, making sure the youngster didn't re-enter Gungan society. During the Trade Federation occupation of Naboo, Tarpals was part of the Gungan Grand Army that fought against the battle droid invaders. Ironically, Tarpals served under Binks, who had unexpectedly received the rank of general by Boss Nass himself. Tarpals stayed close to Binks, trying to keep his commanding officer out of trouble.     By the time of the Clone Wars, Tarpals was promoted to general, and served as leader of the Gungan Grand Army.~generaltarpals_01_169_cb2134d2.jpeg
4fbfb9e9161a452ac01bb488~General Veers~A cool and efficient officer, General Veers led the Imperial assault on Hoth, marching his AT-AT walkers across the planet's frozen plains and destroying the massive generators powering the Rebel base's protective energy shield.~generalveers_01_169_ed056bbf.jpeg
5205cb3c55e4b9f27def0395~Gha Nachkt~Gha Nachkt was an out-of-shape Trandoshan male who operated as a salvage ship captain during the Clone Wars era. He was hovering around the Bothawui in his salvage freighter Vulture's Claw when a battle between the Republic and Separatist Alliance occurred, which allowed him to capture Artoo-Detoo. During that battle, some of the debris he picked up included the remains of Anakin Skywalker's Jedi Starfighter and his droid, R2-D2. Knowing the astromech droid would be full of useful intelligence for the Separatists, he arranged to sell the droid to General Grievous. After performing an autopsy on the droid and finding far more secret Republic information than he expected, he tried extorting the droid general for more money.~gha-nachkt_cfe5effb.jpeg
5205ce3d032f69180db481b7~Gobi Glie~Gobi Glie was a male Twi'lek from Ryloth with a bluish-purple complexion. During the era of The Clone Wars he worked with Cham Syndulla with the Twi'lek Resistance that fought against the Separatist Alliance. He survived those conflicts long enough to join Syndulla's Free Ryloth movement that resisted the Galactic Empire during the dark times.~gobi-glie_439f62ea.jpeg
541981085ef5151a9d7298e4~Gooti Terez~A purple-hued Theelin, Gooti Terez was a spirited rebel. She served on the self-proclaimed Iron Squadron, alongside her friends Mart Mattin and Jonner Jin. Together, they fearlessly engaged Imperials, proving to be capable fighters.~gooti-terez_a997235c.jpeg
4fbfb9ebd6d18b95e98e2e55~Gorga the Hutt~One of the ruling members of the Hutt Council, Gorga the Hutt kept his sharp eye and pudgy fingers on the flow of credits into Hutt coffers. Knowing full well the scheming nature that the Hutts take deep pride in, Gorga ably accounted for skimming and outright theft while ensuring the criminal enterprise remained healthy enough to thrive. He would regularly meet with his fellow Hutt councilors in the halls of the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta, where his voice was given equal measure, though it was not as weighty as that of the mighty Jabba.~gorgathehutt_01_169_42df5405.jpeg
51ee0b4bea6c31cc396acea4~Goss Toowers~Goss Toowers, a member of the Shozer species, is one of the hard-working technicians who keep the Resistance base on D'Qar running. Toowers and his fellow ground crew members handle everything from monitoring the arrival and departure of ships to maintaining the Resistance's X-wing squadrons - often the only line of defense for worlds targeted by the First Order.~ep7_ia_56067_copy_451033d2.jpeg
53d3641c019d4c6a11ae4024~Governor Pryce~Arihnda Pryce was governor of the Lothal Sector, a confident leader, and believer in the Empire. While Lothal was under control, Pryce still wanted to eradicate the rebel threat. To do so, she asked for the Empire's seventh fleet, citing the need for a commander who "sees a bigger picture."~governor-pryce_4cf3bde4.jpeg
4fbfb9eeedfb8f1f9f756a65~Governor Roshti~An elder Togruta, Roshti governed the artisan colony of Kiros during the Clone Wars. A quiet and reserved man, Roshti only wanted peace for himself and his fellow Togruta. He tried to remain apart from the Clone Wars, taking no stance in the battle between Republic and Separatist forces. But when Count Dooku arrived on the planet, forcing his brand of "protection" onto Kiros, Roshti was compelled to obey. Dooku offered the Togruta sanctuary -- but an alliance with the Zygerrians meant that the entire colony of 50,000 Togruta were transported to the deplorable mining installation on Kadavo, a grueling facility fueled by the toil of slaves.~governorroshti_01_169_ff36914b.jpeg
503c234726a11a1290d2f244~Governor Torul Blom~Torul Blom was the governor of Pau City on Utapau. During Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker's investigation of the city, Blom tells the Jedi that their presence has upset the citizens of his city and claims there is no Separatist presence on the planet.~image_2aa22fbb.jpeg
53d363cd996526cd144d0045~Grand Admiral Thrawn~When Governor Pryce of Lothal wanted a stronger commander to dismantle the rebellion, the Empire answered with Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn was a male Chiss, with striking blue skin, red eyes, and an angular face, known for his brilliant strategic mind and ruthlessness. He was determined to "pull the rebels apart piece by piece."~grand-admiral-thrawn2_bda317f3.jpeg
4fbfbe1d861461c1642afce2~Grand Moff Tarkin~An ambitious, ruthless proponent of military power, Wilhuff Tarkin became a favorite of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and rose rapidly through the Imperial ranks. Shortly after the Empire's creation, he was put in charge of the construction of the Death Star. Tarkin saw the Death Star as a way to crush all dissent to the Empire's rule -- fear of the station's planet-killing superlaser would keep the galaxy's star systems in line. He demonstrated the station's power by destroying Alderaan, but died soon afterwards when the Death Star itself was destroyed.~tarkin_01_169_97d0a95c.jpeg
511fd345942251a8166e1c9e~Greeata~Greeata joined the Max Rebo Band as a backup singer and dancer for some of the ensemble's gigs, including their performance at Jabba's palace. Her orange hair and ample jewelry ensured she got noticed even by listeners lacking musical taste.~greeata_813f2567.jpeg
4fbfb9f1a62d66c822310fb7~Greedo~Greedo was a Rodian bounty hunter with a tapir-like snout, bulbous eyes, pea-green skin, and a crest of spines atop his skull. He was overzealous and a bit slow on the take, not to mention a pretty poor shot with a blaster. Though he fancied himself a big time bounty hunter in the employ of no less an underworld figure than Jabba the Hutt, in truth, no one took him too seriously.~greedo_01_169_3e4b96ef.jpeg
4fbfb9f4dfff7c541cb163cf~Gregor~An elite clone commando thought lost at the grueling Battle of Sarrish, CC-5576-39 survived a shuttle crash that left him stranded on the distant world of Abafar, stripped of memory and identity. He was found and rehabilitated by Mr. Borkus, and unscrupulous diner owner from the dusty town of Pons Ora. When the Republic agents of D-Squad discovered Gregor, they rekindled his memories of duty, service, and honor, and the commando reclaimed his armor and fought to a spectacular finish to ensure D-Squad carried out its crucial mission.~gregor_01_169_bfaa3cd4.jpeg
52ae3524671d95fcfe69df19~Gron~Gron was a proud Lasat and survivor of the Empire's purge of his homeworld. He served under Zeb in the Honor Guard, but came to reject violence in the wake of his people's battles with the Imperials. Gron, along with Chava the Wise, were rescued from Imperial custody by the Ghost crew. Along with Zeb, the three Lasat completed an ancient ritual that led to Lirasan, the original homeworld of their people, and a place they could start anew.~gron_2c097f8e.jpeg
52f22e5b44674e8f5d790558~Grummgar~A hulking Dowutin, Grummgar was at Maz Kanata's castle when Han Solo, Finn and Rey visited. Sitting beside the bounty hunter and First Order spy Bazine Netal, Grummgar was given a wide berth by the castle's other guests. He makes his credits as a mercenary and big-game hunter, with his kills including the molsume, a predator native to Ithor.~grummgar_20545f02.jpeg
55d5908376e683ca8ae7beac~Guild Slave Master Proach~Proach, a ruthless Trandoshan, oversees slaves working in the Mining Guild's ore crawlers on Lothal. Wielding an electro-whip, he is an imposing presence and deadly warrior.~guild-slave-master-proach_e52ba9ee.jpeg
4fbfb9f89d7db1973a5ea3f1~Gungi~A rare example of a Wookiee in the Jedi Order, Gungi had a lively, inquisitive face whose wide smile was punctuated with a snaggletooth emerging from his lower jaw. Like many Wookiees, Gungi was temperamental and expressive -- and controlling his patience proved to be a real challenge. When Gungi was a Jedi youngling during the time of the Clone Wars, he needed to learn to slow down his impulsive ways in order to pass the ancient rite of passage ritual known as The Gathering.~gungi_01_169_a4ae3ed6.jpeg
4fbfba1d6138fc9c67aa0b87~Gwarm~A leathery-faced Weequay pirate with a scratchy voice and a mask of yellowed skin around his eyes, Gwarm served as a loyal lieutenant to the charismatic pirate chieftain Hondo Ohnaka during the Clone Wars. Like a true bully, Gwarm delighted in victimizing the weak who could not defend themselves -- like the nysillim spice farmers of Felucia or Jedi younglings on a training mission.~gwarm_01_169_c11e93ee.jpeg
532f9ab74d5ee6dbcd19dd13~Gwellis Bagnoro~An Onodone with a mysterious past, Gwellis Bagnoro was an expert forger with a specialty in travel documents - which made him much in demand at Maz's castle. He was rarely spotted without Izby, a pet barghest that defended him from harm.~gwellis-bagnoro_6dc2e5d3.jpeg
4fbfba2083733b95e98e2e55~Halle Burtoni~The strong-willed female Kaminoan Senator is well-respected in both the Galactic Senate and in her own world of Kamino which is known for its production of the clone troopers. The aged Kaminoan bartered her clone production efforts into a seat in the Senate, and she longed for nothing more than to see Padme's peace-promoting efforts fail. Senator Burtoni's aggressive and intrusive behavior made her not only an intimidating character, but often a suspect in criminal and unethical activities to further her political career.~halle_burtoni_17da8c4f.jpeg
4fbbf1b735dc2ef08582f452~Han Solo~Han Solo rose from an impoverished childhood on the mean streets of Corellia to become one of the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. As captain of the Millennium Falcon, Han and his co-pilot Chewbacca came to believe in the cause of galactic freedom, joining Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa in the fight against the Empire. After the Battle of Endor, Han faced difficult times in a chaotic galaxy, leading to a shattering confrontation with his estranged son Ben.~solo-han-solo-main_890f79bd.jpeg
4fbfba25941261c1642afce2~Hay-Zu~The ruler of the Patitites, the Big Hay-Zu did not let his diminutive size contain his ego or sense of entitlement. Indeed, the portly Patitite was a giant among his kind, ruling with the tiniest iron fist. The Patitites did his every bidding, and should a trespasser wander into Patitite territories, watchful scouts like Jimba and Tagoo would lead a hunting party to subdue the interloper. R2-D2 and C-3PO were trussed up and dragged before the Big Hay-Zu during the Clone Wars, leading to a first contact experience that would flatten the hierarchy of power in Patitite society.~hayzu_01_169_1b2c3b8f.jpeg
4fbfba2833f8e4821c3c0271~Hera Syndulla~The captain and heart of the Ghost crew, Hera Syndulla was a gifted pilot and leader. While Hera was a strong commander -- and especially adept at dogfighting with TIE fighters -- she was also warm and nurturing. The Twi'lek could bring out the best in her team, which consisted of very different personalities, making them believe in themselves, each other, and their struggle against the Empire.~hera-syndulla-s3_cf5e7f07.jpeg
5192253c6d0d7e49196a4225~Hermi Odle~A burly thug with a shady past, Hermi Odle was one of Jabba the Hutt's resident gangsters on Tatooine. Wise members of the Hutt's court knew Odle was far more dangerous than his stooped posture, shuffling gait and drooping lip suggested.~hermie-odle-16-9_5bb4fd3a.jpeg
519499a7efde2dfc38bb6ecd~Hermione Bagwa~Hermione Bagwa was a waitress at Dex's Diner in the Coco Town section of Coruscant, serving a never-ending parade of clients that included speeder drivers, maintenance techs, ambassadors and Senate aides -- and sometimes even a Jedi Knight or two.~hermione-bagwa-main-image_edc65dfa.jpeg
4fbfba2cf8106d1d33fa85c5~Hondo Ohnaka~A tough, pragmatic Weequay, Hondo Ohnaka led a notorious Outer Rim pirate gang from his headquarters on Florrum. A former colleague of Jango Fett and a former lover of Aurra Sing, Ohnaka won fame during the Clone Wars when he kidnapped Count Dooku, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker and tried to ransom all three for a big payout. Since that incident, he maintained a peculiar relationship with the Republic -- respecting the Jedi Knights, but not being above robbing them blind or betraying them. During the age of the Empire, Ohnaka found himself running a solo operation, but he continued scheming and dealing. He was, after all, a pirate through-and-through.~hondo-ohnaka_6ab3af8b.jpeg
514b8a3d07ede0d267f1c982~Hunter (Bad Batch)~Hunter was the leader of Clone Force 99 (also called the Bad Batch), an elite group of clone soldiers. Hunter only slightly resembled normal clones, as he and his team were the result of genetic experimentation -- but his combat prowess was greater than most.~Hunter_8b8d9c31.jpeg
530660abf73824b3bbed2f05~Hurid-327~A red-plated load-lifter droid with oddly jovial programming, HURID-327 spent time at Maz's castle on Takodana, crossing paths with Han Solo, Rey and Finn on their way into the ancient edifice. The towering droid communicates via a binary acoustic signaler.~hurid-327_faf10990.jpeg
4fbfba2fe67916c822310fb7~IG-88~Many people in the galaxy fear droids, what with the memories of the Clone Wars still fresh in their minds. Far more terrifying than battle droids were assassin droids, independently programmed mechanical killers that had no masters. IG-88 is a battered chrome war droid who has become a bounty hunter, and answered Darth Vader's call to capture the Millennium Falcon during the events surrounding the Battle of Hoth.~ig_88_cdd5cc52.jpeg
50552b14b2fecf497d736a7b~IG-RM Thug Droids~IG-RM thug droids proved popular with gangsters, including Lothal's Cikatro Vizago, as they were commonly used as enforcers. The intimidating robotic beings used BlasTech DLT-18 laser rifles, and were developed by Holowan Laboratories -- the manufacturer responsible for IG-86 sentinel droids and General Grievous' dreaded IG-100 MagnaGuards.~image_aaa2fda0.jpeg
532979374d1802821875e053~Ilco Munica~An Abednedo adherent of the once-banned Church of the Force, Ilco Munica dwelled in Tuanul on Jakku alongside fellow members of his faith.

506fa441f7eb39ce207dcc09~Imperial Combat Drivers~Imperial combat drivers were the Empire's elite ground-vehicle pilots. Stationed on worlds such as Lothal, Imperial combat drivers manned everything from speeder bikes to AT-DP walkers. They were also imposing figures, with large helmets, masks, and armor, and proved to be formidable in their battles against rebels and insurgents.~Imperial-Combat-Drivers2_e5cf345b.jpeg

53e85b497e7f5d52616e1530~Instructor Goran~Instructor Goran was the overseer of Skystrike Academy, an elite Imperial Academy for TIE pilots. He was unforgiving with his students, but also blind as to what was truly going on under his watch; it took a surprise visit from Governor Pryce and Agent Kallus to root out an undercover rebel and three defectors, which was a great embarrassment for Goran.~commadant-argin-relik_2832e0f8.jpeg

4fbfba342db6bcf90453278f~Ione Marcy~Ione's large eyes and small voice help her maintain her illusion of being an innocent witness to the crimes found in the deeper levels of Coruscant. Few would suspect her as a thief or accomplice to murder. Ione was a partner in crime to the nimble Cassie Cryar. When the two hoods managed to get a hold of a stolen Jedi lightsaber, they desperately tried to avoid the law.~ione_marcy_1b57b2aa.jpeg
4fbbf3eea860cec9a549844d~Jabba the Hutt~Jabba the Hutt was one of the galaxy's most powerful gangsters, with far-reaching influence in both politics and the criminal underworld.

4fbfba5b0bb781973a5ea3f1~Jakoli~The jungles of Rodia have fostered the idealization of hunters in Rodian culture. Many unqualified rookies attempt to secure respect and accolades by entering the bounty hunting profession, only to find their lives cut short by underestimated prey. Jakoli avoided such a fate by being as ruthless as possible, and never taking chances by bagging live acquisitions. To Jakoli, there was no "dead or alive" for his targets; only "dead."~acw_ia_94357_9d980bc5.jpeg

4fbfba5d7bc4c72e9a83f025~Jango Fett~In the final years of the Republic, Jango Fett was regarded as the best bounty hunter in the galaxy. A proficient marksman and unarmed combatant, Fett was covered in a sleek armored suit that concealed his scarred face. His combat gear featured an arsenal of weaponry, including retractable wrist blades, a snare, dual blaster pistols and other more exotic tools of the trade. In combat, Jango used his harnessed jetpack to gain the advantage of speed and height over his enemies. The backpack also carried a nasty surprise -- an explosive rocket could be launched from it. For interstellar travel, Jango traveled aboard his well-worn starship, Slave I.~jangofett_01_169_884cefab.jpeg
5205ec38ffc8a9180db481b7~Janus Greejatus~Greejatus was a gaunt human in flowing robes and garish hat who served as one of Emperor Palpatine's closest advisors.

4fbfba6014c8243e447d0771~Jar Jar Binks~A clumsy, well-meaning Gungan outcast on Naboo, Jar Jar Binks struggled to prove his worth throughout his life. Putting his awkward past behind him, Jar Jar left the swamps of Naboo to enter the even murkier waters of Coruscant politics, becoming a representative for his people in the galactic capital. There, his best intentions and eagerness to serve were exploited by scheming Senators and others in positions of power.~jarjarbinks_01_169_c70767ab.jpeg
53321a3d0fec6fc6feeae7f1~Jashco Phurus~Notable for wearing the red robes of a Tricorraan raider, Jashco Phurus was a notorious pirate who prowled the Arrowhead region near Coruscant.

The burly rebel pilot flew an X-wing at the Battle of Yavin under the call sign Red 6. His X-wing developed a mechanical problem early in the battle, leaving him struggling to maneuver. Before Porkins or his astromech could fix the problem, one of the Death Star's turbolasers zeroed in on the X-wing, incinerating it and killing Porkins instantly.~jek-porkins-main-image_0b8d2d13.jpeg

4fbfba68916c9c9c67aa0b87~Jinx~A Twi'lek youngling, Jinx's optimism was chipped away by the harsh realities of survival in the Wasskah jungle.

4fbfba6ed530bec9a549844d~Jiro~A pirate captain, Jiro attempted to salvage a transport that carried the Sith brothers Darth Maul and Savage Opress. Maul throttled Jiro with the Force, and made the attentive pirate an offer: his life spared as well as a trove of riches in exchange for his servitude. Jiro agreed to follow the commands of these new, impressive crime lords and offered to recruit more pirates. When Maul's bid to conquer Florrum failed, Hondo Ohnaka reminded his former pirates that their new Sith allies had no interest in helping them. Hondo called on all his pirates to pillage the now undefended cargo vessel used by the Sith, earning their loyalty once more by appealing to their boundless greed.~jiro_01_169_502b82ce.jpeg

51fcd8ba1489900bc0ceab8e~Johhar Kessen~Ex-senator Johhar Kessen, hails from the forested planet of Dandoran, in the Doran system. While not having been a very politically impactful planet, it's hub of gambling and smuggling offered Kessen the unique opportunity of creating a vast network of contacts and influence throughout the galaxy's seedy underground. Known to be quite over confident and even a bit of a chauvinist in his dealings with his associates, Johhar is often preoccupied with big game hunting. He owns a rifle that he's named "Karina."~johharcampaignart_b57d8a1b.jpeg

541982897a964888e51649a4~Jonner Jin~Jonner Jin was the muscle of Iron Squadron, a trio of young rebels from Mykapo. But Jonner's heart was his real strength, showing unending loyalty to his friends Mart Mattin and Gooti Terez.~jonner-jin_33ebe114.jpeg
539ad187e560f501c750748b~Jyn Erso~Putting behind a checkered past by lending her skills to a greater cause, Jyn Erso is impetuous, defiant, and eager to bring the battle to the Empire. Used to operating alone, she finds higher purpose by taking on a desperate mission for the Rebel Alliance.~jyn-erso_ccf70c46.jpeg
539ac7a5bd267128d59fa2d9~K-2SO (Kay-Tuesso)~A reprogrammed Imperial security droid now loyal to the Alliance, K-2SO is an alarming sight standing within a secret Rebel base. The pragmatic droid is an effective insertion agent, as he can blend in perfectly at Imperial installations and outposts.~k-2s0-main-b_73a8fed8.jpeg
4fbfba9b72011ec9a549844d~K0-5D~K0-5D began as a general purpose ASP droid, but has been extensively modified for gladiatorial combat. Fighting aboard the sparring pits of the Weequay pirate ship Marauder, K0-5D usually emerges triumphant, thanks to its powerful, steel-shredding servos and his integrated flame thrower. For his fighting prowess, the Weequays have taken to calling it "Maximo."~k05d_01_169_e33530da.jpeg
51fcd8b29da2174e3d02dd43~Kada Jahr~Kada is a young female Devaronian who has worked for Jabba the Hutt in recent years, in charge of "security." Kada was hired by Jabba because of her extensive network of smugglers and mercenaries in the underground, as well as her reputation as the progeny of a well know and dangerous merc, Arann Jahr. Arann was mysteriously killed during a routine smuggling operation which has propelled Kada's desire to embed herself in his world. In the relatively few years working as a merc liaison and security expert, Kada's exemplary work did not go unnoticed by important smugglers throughout the galaxy. Kada is known to come off cold, but is not without humor, which is often relayed sarcastically. She's shadowy and mysterious, and while appearing to be an unsavory and untrustworthy character on the surface, is in fact, extremely loyal and dependable.~kada_background_2e4e0257.jpeg
4fbfba9e2389ccf90453278f~Kalifa~Long stranded on the jungle moon of Wasskah, Kalifa began to waver from the ideals of the Jedi Order. Though still strong in the Force, she became crippled by fear and despair. She tried to remain strong enough to look over her fellow castaways.~kalifa_01_169_9916a1ca.jpeg
4fbfbaa0a4872c9c67aa0b87~Kanan Jarrus~Not every Jedi perished in Order 66. Kanan Jarrus survived the Emperor's purge, going underground for years and hiding the truth about who he really was. To keep his past a secret, Kanan carried a blaster -- an uncommon practice for a Jedi -- and used a lightsaber that had to be assembled. He was a leader among the Ghost crew, a small group of rebels looking to strike back against the Empire, and with the emergence of the Force-sensitive Ezra, once again embraced his identity as a Jedi Knight.~kanan-jarrus-s3_94b2ce6e.jpeg
4fbfbaa3ad32652ac01bb488~Katooni~A bright-eyed Tholothian girl, Katooni was a Jedi youngling during the time of the Clone Wars. During that conflict, she underwent the ancient Jedi ritual of The Gathering, where she explored the Crystal Cave of Ilum to seek out her lightsaber crystal. Inexperienced and timid, Katooni needed to find confidence in her abilities in order to succeed.~katooni_01_169_9d10cbac.jpeg
532855ee19ac47a5fd388bd7~Kaydel Connix~A lieutenant at the D'Qar Resistance base, Kaydel Connix coordinated communications during the Starkiller Base raid. She then helped organize the evacuation of D'Qar and served aboard the Raddus. Connix shared Poe Dameron's misgivings about Vice Admiral Holdo, conspiring with the starfighter ace against their new commander and joining his brief-lived mutiny. She survived the Battle of Crait, escaping with the remnants of the Resistance.~tlj-connix-main-image-2_b744059a.jpeg
56c80eb131e438f6de800c64~Kedpin Shoklop~A diminutive Wermal, Kedpin Shoklop - his friends call him Ked - is visiting Canto Bight for a two-week vacation, his reward for being named Vaportech's Salesbeing of the Year. Ked has seen Canto Bight's highs and lows, and now seeks to unwind with a soothing massage at Zord's Spa.~ep8-076637_jw_9f26b27a.jpeg
4fbfbaa69553ac541cb163cf~Keeper Agruss~A Zygerrian slavemaster who led the slaving operation on Kadavo, Agruss delighted in his superiority over his pathetic charges. Agruss flaunted his power freely, punishing and executing slaves at a whim to ensure no one every questioned his authority. The overweight Zygerrian hovered aloft on a repulsorlift chair, exuding an air of decadence. Agruss particularly delighted in tormenting Obi-Wan Kenobi, the first ever Jedi to be interred at his grueling facility.~keeperagruss_01_169_aae1c820.jpeg
51fcd8c5712cbe1bdb0eff14~Kekit~Kekit was the leader of a small Jawa clan being oppressed on Tatooine by a tribe of Tuskens. Jennica Pierce saw an opportunity to form a much needed alliance with the Jawas in order for Rebel forces to better navigate the sandy terrain of Tatooine, so she offered to help in their plight with the Tuskens. Saponza and his partner played an integral part in this campaign, earning Kekit's respect and a promise of future aid from his clan.~kekit_background_384e1185.jpeg
524d6b2e7cc3dbea2f1cb894~Ketsu Onyo~Ketsu Onyo was an old friend of the rebel Sabine, with both attending and escaping the Imperial Academy together. But they eventually took different paths. Ketsu became a bounty hunter, contracting with the Black Sun syndicate. During one job to recover a droid courier, she once again encountered Sabine, who looked to bring the droid to the rebellion. Their meeting was tense, but they put their differences aside to survive an attack from the Empire. In the end, Ketsu rejected an offer to join the rebellion -- for the time being.~ketsu-onyo_65ed54ca.jpeg
4fbfbaa975308d0b4cdaa6b5~Ki-Adi-Mundi~Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Cerean alien who sat on the Jedi Council. A humanoid being, Ki's most distinguishing physical feature was an enlarged conical cranium that contained a binary brain. When Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn reported a Sith attack during the events surrounding the Battle of Naboo, Ki-Adi-Mundi expressed shock at the notion. "Impossible," he remarked, "the Sith have been extinct for a millennium." He also failed to see how far Count Dooku had fallen from the Jedi ideals just prior to the Clone Wars, believing that Dooku was incapable of violence or murder.~kiadimundi_01_169_0a8842d3.jpeg
4fbfbaac73e324821c3c0271~Kiera Swan~Pirates and bounty hunters rarely mix well; the former group is devoted to breaking interstellar shipping laws and the latter are licensed to hunt criminals, they often wind up on the opposite ends of intense and destructive blaster-fights. But Kiera Swan was skilled enough to make the transition from notorious Weequay pirate, to legendary bounty hunter. With a price on her head from her ship-raiding past, Kiera tended to accept illegal bounties and avoided working closely with other hunters, since she didn't trust them.~acw_ia_94347_a7d2b0ac.jpeg
5205f579efae79180db481b7~Kin Robb~The honorable Senator Kin Robb served in the Galactic Senate during the Clone Wars. She was present for many important happenings during this era, including the attack by the Zillo Beast, assassination attempts made by Death Watch, and her service as a juror in Ahsoka Tano's trial for bombing the Jedi Temple.~kin-robb_768f9892.jpeg
4fbfbbb4bb57fd0b4cdaa6b5~King Katuunko~The sovereign ruler of the Toydarians, King Katuunko valued honesty above all else. He was chiefly concerned with protecting his people from the ravages of the Clone Wars, and was hesitant to ally himself to either the Republic or Separatist factions. After Master Yoda impressed Katuunko with a display of Jedi character, Katuunko committed his world to support the Republic.~king_katuunko_62c6f114.jpeg
4fbfbbb744b96cf90453278f~King Manchucho~The leader of the Aleena, King Manchucho was a fair and intelligent leader. He was gregarious and eager to please, always serving as a welcome host to any off-world guests. Manchucho wanted a peaceful coexistence with the beings that lived beneath the surface of his planet, even though their ways and culture remained alien to him.~acw_ia_77554_37f39ba8.jpeg
4fbfbbb9bb3051c1642afce2~King Ramsis Dendup~As the galaxy began to split with the Separatist crisis that escalated into the Clone Wars, King Ramsis Dendup of Onderon looked on with disapproval and dread. The conflict would spill onto the borders of his home, and he would have to make a choice. But he saw no virtue in either the Republic or the Confederacy, recognizing the corruption that rotted within both governments. Dendup decided that the best course of action for his people would be to remain neutral in the conflict. For this, he was branded an indecisive coward and ousted from the throne by those who saw opportunity for change in power.~king_ramsis_dendu_e14063fe.jpeg
4fbfbbbc7884ad0b4cdaa6b5~King Sanjay Rash~King Ramsis Dendup refused to commit Onderon to the Clone Wars, thinking that neutrality would spare the planet from the violent conflict. Sanjay Rash knew better. To ensure Onderon's prosperity and strength in the shifting galaxy would require a strong alliance -- and that meant striking an accord with the Separatists. Through methods cloaked in intrigue, Rash assumed the crown of Onderon, deposing Dendup and branding him a powerless old crone. Rash then allowed the Separatists to establish a firm foothold, cementing his rule of the planet.~king_sanjay_rash_bae847df.jpeg
4fbab0bea63f6ec9a549844d~Kit Fisto~Kit Fisto is a striking example of an alien Jedi, a Nautolan with large eyes, and a gathered tangle of flexible tentacle-tresses extending from his head. He is at home in the waters of aquatic planets, like his native Glee Anselm. As a Jedi Master, Fisto has an intense focus, particularly in combat. He is also much more laid back and capable of enjoying a hearty chuckle than some of his humorless colleagues.~kitfisto_01_169_21517d01.jpeg
4fbaab1a5e2d01973a5ea3f1~Kitster~Kitster was one of Anakin Skywalker's friends before the young podracing champ left Tatooine for the life of a Jedi. An optimistic human boy about the same age as Anakin, Kitster was part of Anakin's pit team in the fateful Boonta Eve Classic race that saw young Skywalker win his freedom.~kitster_1928585a.jpeg
50475a398c269e02fb5b80bc~Kitwarr~Kitwarr was a young Wookiee captured by Imperials and forced to work in the spice mines of Kessel. After a daring rescue by the crew of the Ghost, he and his father, Wulffwarro, were set free.~image_3e1a872c.jpeg
51dc5ca04810bbb2c118c33c~Klaatu~A Kadas'sa'Nikto from Kintan, Klaatu was a henchman of Jabba the Hutt, and spent his time at the Hutt's palace repairing skiffs, eagerly awaiting executions and amassing ever-larger gambling debts. Klaatu confronted Luke Skywalker during the battle at the Great Pit of Carkoon, but fled after Luke disarmed him with a stroke of his lightsaber. He died when Jabba's sail barge exploded.~klaatu-main-image_8074b83b.jpeg
54577b2b311d6a0c1d2285dc~Klik-Klak~Klik-Klak was the lone Geonosian survivor following the Empire's eradication of his people. He hid in the Geonosis caves, fearful of outsiders, and used battle droids left over from the Clone Wars as a means of protection. But he wasn't just protecting himself; Klik-Klak was the keeper of a queen egg, which could be the key to rebuilding his kind.~klik-klak_1743e561.jpeg
4fbfbbc1cb249d0b4cdaa6b5~Korkie Kryze~The nephew of Duchess Satine Kryze, Cadet Korkie attended the Royal Academy of Government on Mandalore, where he was being groomed for leadership. His keen insights and ambitious personality suggested that he would go far. Together with his friends Soniee, Amis, and Lagos, Korkie helped expose corruption in the highest levels of government, and later helped rescue his aunt from wrongful imprisonment during the rise of the Shadow Collective.~korkiekryze_01_169_e397dcde.jpeg
53104b5f031a38344d2fbddf~Korr Sella~The capable, no-nonsense Korr Sella assisted Leia Organa during her career in the New Republic's Galactic Senate and remained in her service when Leia left politics to establish the Resistance. Sella served as Leia's link to the Senate, bringing intelligence to allies and supporters who agreed with her warnings about the First Order. Sella was on Hosnian Prime as Leia's envoy when the Starkiller superweapon destroyed the system, ending her life.~korr-sella_fba116a4.jpeg
4fbfbbc5d4e881c1642afce2~Krismo Sodi~Krismo was the most skilled and deadly member of the Kage Warriors, serving as their leader at the time of the Clone Wars. From atop a galloping milodon, he led his warriors through the subterranean caverns of Quarzite against the Belugan forces of Lord Otua Blank.~krismosodi_01_169_17f11e75.jpeg
51edc35960065816b7d20dab~Kylo Ren~The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, Ben Solo was seduced by the dark side of the Force and renamed himself Kylo Ren, becoming the First Order's champion and Supreme Leader Snoke's student. Kylo killed his father and seeks to destroy his mother's Resistance and the remnants of the Jedi Order. Though a servant of the dark side, he still struggles against the pull of the light side of the Force.~kylo-ren-db-main_e2e6f666.jpeg
569fcff31e7fed39a5266563~L3-37~A self-made droid built from astromech and protocol parts, L3-37 is an enlightened navigator who cares deeply about droid rights. Her ability to connect directly with the Millennium Falcon's navicomputer lets the freighter plot faster routes than those traveled by more cautious ships. L3-37's habit of speaking her mind and her relentless advocacy for mechanicals can alienate organic beings.~hs-ff-002814_b09d97b4.jpeg
56ce74412e6ccf3e50da771f~Lady Proxima~The fearsome Grindalid matriarch of the White Worms, Lady Proxima rules Corellia's black market from a tangle of sewer tunnels beneath Corellia's Coronet City. A briny pool serves as a throne room where Proxima feeds her hatchlings and commands the urchins known as scrumrats, sending them out to pick pockets and barter stolen goods.~lady-proxima-main-b_b789bf62.jpeg
4fbfbbc9501e8ef08582f452~Lagos~During the Clone Wars, Lagos attended the prestigious Mandalorian Royal Academy of Government, an institution that grooms the best and brightest of Mandalorian youth to help steer the future of the planet. This future, however, was dominated by the influence of criminal interlopers. First, the unscrupulous Prime Minister Almec embroiled the planet in the black market. Lagos was one of the cadets led by Korkie Kryze who helped expose this plot. A cautious student, she sometimes found the adventure-seeking nature of her classmates overwhelming. She would find courage when circumstances demanded it, however, even piloting the escape speeder during a brash jail break that freed the wrongly imprisoned Duchess Satine Kryze.~lagos_01_169_b89769a8.jpeg
5192391459d910c7aa1b9403~Lama Su~The lanky Prime Minister of remote Kamino, Lama Su oversaw the creation of the Galactic Republic's first clone armies. That effort gave his storm-swept homeworld influence in the Republic, but also made it a target of the Separatist military.~kaminoan-main-image_40db5ba5.jpeg
4fbbf62a07d2fef08582f452~Lando Calrissian~Lando Calrissian made a name for himself as captain of the Millennium Falcon and a sportsman seeking a fortune at the galaxy's sabacc tables. After he lost his beloved ship to Han Solo, he spent years living the high life and pursuing get-rich-quick schemes, with uneven results. He went semi-respectable as the administrator of Cloud City, only to be drawn into the fight against the Empire. His quick wit and daring helped the Alliance destroy the second Death Star, completing Lando's evolution from smooth-talking smuggler to galactic hero.~solo-lando-calrissian-b-main_69b65b65.jpeg
4fbfbbedabc64d1d33fa85c5~Latts Razzi~Beautiful and deadly, Latts Razzi was a Theelin bounty hunter who operated during the Clone Wars. Used to high style and first class comforts, Razzi charged exorbitant rates but had the skills to back them. Aside from her pinpoint accuracy with a blaster pistol, she was an expert unarmed fighter in several forms of exotic combat. Draped around her shoulders were triple rows of a scaled boa, which when snapped like a whip or lariat, proved to be much more than a fashion accessory.~lattsrazzi_01_169_acdc19b1.jpeg
4fbbf9bd3c1cb1973a5ea3f1~Leia Organa~Princess Leia Organa was one of the Rebel Alliance's greatest leaders, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the tyranny of the Empire. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranks among the galaxy's great heroes. But life under the New Republic has not been easy for Leia. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career have been accompanied by more personal losses.~leia-organa-feature-image_d0f5e953.jpeg
4fbfbbf0ffe064821c3c0271~Letta Turmond~Hardened by a life in the working class levels of Coruscant, Letta Turmond had a jaundiced view of the Jedi Order and the leadership of the Galactic Republic. Her husband, Jackar Bowmani, was a technician who worked in the Jedi Temple, and devoted his life to supporting the Order. With the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Bowmani's expertise was used to arm Republic gunships, and it galled Letta to see what was once an institution of peace and justice transformed into an instrument of war. She became an activist opposed to the Jedi involvement of the war, but her beliefs were so radical that they crossed the line into terrorism.~lettaturmond_01_169_21b76a7a.jpeg
51fcd8acfd5206aa50e73bd2~Liana Kor~Known as "Iron" Liana, her associates in the smuggling business often describe Kor as "stubborn as a zakkeg, and twice as mean." Liana Kor often finds herself entangled in conflicts between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire, as she often targets arms shipments for her pirating and smuggling operations. She has no love for either side, and will often attempt to play both sides to get what she wants. This hasn't earned her much respect, but is widely know not to be trifled with, as she lives up to her nickname.~liana_background_7990e77c.jpeg
56fb9efca88dc659d7585c55~Lieutenant Bolandin~A veteran Imperial, Bolandin has long regarded Corporal Han Solo as a troublemaker with a big mouth - and the mudtroopers battling on Mimban have trouble enough as it is. When Solo is turned over to Bolandin as a deserter, he orders stormtroopers to throw him in with "the Beast" - a Wookiee prisoner held in a makeshift prison.~solo-db-mimban-lieutenant-main-image_05361270.jpeg
52ebda6df6acc70a50a946d7~Lieutenant Dicer~One of the rebellion's pilots, Lieutenant Dicer was among the first to try to set up a base on Atollon. Unfortunately for Dicer, the world was not as desolate as believed -- huge spider-like creatures called krykna lived below the surface. After the krykna attacked, all that was left of Dicer was her helmet.~lt-dicer_eefbfe94.jpeg
531047d081219dc26577fcfa~Lieutenant Mitaka~A young officer in the First Order Navy, Dopheld Mitaka graduated at the top of his Academy class and received a coveted post aboard the Finalizer. It was a plum assignment Mitaka would sometimes regret, as his duties included telling Kylo Ren of the First Order's failure to capture the fugitive Resistance droid BB-8.~lieutenant-mitaka_e941988f.jpeg
54928cb02b90a8b972c90f3d~Lieutenant Mytus Adema~Mytus Adema is an ambitious young officer assigned to the Scarif Citadel. He disdains his senior officer, General Ramda, as lazy and overconfident, and hopes to supplant him in the eyes of Director Krennic. Adema sees the Death Star as a welcome symbol of Imperial glory and might.~lieutenant-mytus-adema-main_6a310f6a.jpeg
4fbfbbf3681dc6c822310fb7~Lobot~Never far from Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian's side was Lobot, Calrissian's aide and Cloud City's computer liaison officer. Lobot is a human male with a shiny, brain-enhancing device wrapped around the back of his skull that allowed him to contact directly with the city's central computer.~lobot_01_169_8a50d7ae.jpeg
51932c5562fddca5878ddc15~Logray~The shaman of the Ewok village, Logray's rituals ensured his tribe remained in harmony with Endor's forest spirits. When a golden god visited his planet, Logray ordered the sacrifice of offworlders in this deity's honor -- only to somehow incur the god's wrath. No one ever said faith was easy.~logray-main-image_05b9e023.jpeg
4fbfbbf653256ec9a549844d~Lok Durd~Lok Durd was an obese Neimoidian general in the army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. A flamboyant and heartless weapons developer, some say if Lok Durd could make half the noise on the battlefield that he does in the war room, then the Separatists would have won the war. Durd longed to impress Count Dooku with his battlefield inventions. The Neimoidian general unleashed the Defoliator on the planet Maridun during the Clone Wars.~lokdrud_01_169_7a169264.jpeg
51922901c4ebb40cae3cbd30~Lolo Purs~As a Rodian representative in the Galactic Senate, Lolo Purs assisted her mentor, Senator Onaconda Farr. But Lolo felt betrayed by Farr's brief dealings with the Separatists, and hatched a scheme to do away with Uncle Ono.~lolo-purs-main-image_8277d4a2.jpeg
4fbfbbf926aca4821c3c0271~Lom Pyke~During the Clone Wars, Lom Pyke was the leader of a syndicate of spice dealers known as the Pykes. Operating out of Oba Diah, they controlled the lucrative trade that delivered spice to the ruling crime families of the lower levels of Coruscant. His spice-stained grin and hands suggested that he was more than just a dealer of the contraband substance. Sensing profit and opportunity to expand his operations, Lom allied his forces with Darth Maul's growing Shadow Collective.~lom_c6282f93.jpeg
527231d42ab6f71b3e0db938~Lor San Tekka~A legendary traveler and explorer, Lor San Tekka was a longtime ally of the New Republic and the Resistance. After the Battle of Endor, San Tekka helped Luke Skywalker recover secret Jedi lore that the Empire had tried to erase. He then retired to live simply on Jakku, where he followed the dictates of the once-forbidden Church of the Force. Leia Organa sent Poe Dameron in search of San Tekka, who gave him a portion of a map revealing Luke's planet of exile. San Tekka was then killed by Kylo Ren, who sought the same information.~lor-san-tekka_3ebccd38.jpeg
4fbfbbfc9569d1973a5ea3f1~Lott Dod~To hear Lott Dod tell it, the actions of Nute Gunray did not reflect the true intents of the Trade Federation, which remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. Sure, the Separatist Alliance did use Trade Federation starships and battle droids as part of their fighting forces in the Clone Wars, but this was equipment legitimately purchased in the open market. The Trade Federation was committed to commerce across the entire galaxy, and had no interest in getting caught up in territorial wars, Dodd would say. In truth, the Senator received a healthy income to ensure both sides of the war stay well equipped.~lottdod_01_169_7219a66c.jpeg
56627851d512a2d8c229a4ca~Lovey~A striking figure with a geometric red hairdo and a fitted lattice dress, "Lovey" is a familiar sight by the side of the Master Codebreaker at the gaming tables of the Canto Casino. "Lovey" has her own secrets -- including her true name, which she has yet to reveal to her companion.~last-jedi-databank-lovey-main-image_dbb1cbcd.jpeg
4fbbf8b822e24ef08582f452~Luke Skywalker~Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy's greatest mysteries. Haunted by Ben Solo's fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a distant world, ignoring the galaxy's pleas for help. But his solitude would be interrupted - and Luke Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the struggle between good and evil.~luke-skywalker-main_5a38c454_461eebf5.jpeg
4fbfbbff85f3852ac01bb488~Luminara Unduli~A green-skinned Mirialan, Luminara Unduli served the Jedi Order during the final years of the Galactic Republic, and trained the capable Padawan Barriss Offee. A no-nonsense Jedi Master, Luminara fought in Clone Wars battles such as Geonosis and Kashyyyk, and was thought to have perished during Order 66. In reality, she'd been taken into Imperial custody and executed, with holographic transmissions of her captivity used as bait to capture fugitive Jedi.~luminara_c05b2971.jpeg
4fbfbc02ce69b6c822310fb7~Lux Bonteri~The son of Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri, Lux was young, idealistic, and skeptical of the aims of the Republic and the Jedi Knights. His father was a fervent supporter of the Separatists, and was killed by clone troopers on Aargonar. Lux did not know what to make of Ahsoka Tano and her visit to Separatist space. After a failed peace overture begun by Mina extended to the Republic, Lux's mother died, assassinated on Count Dooku's orders. After making an ill-fated effort to avenge her by killing Dooku, Lux joined the anti-Separatist resistance on his homeworld of Onderon. After the rebels defeated the Separatists, Lux became Onderon's Republic Senator.~lux_bonteri_13fdb7b3.jpeg
51949e8d53db192727243679~Lyn Me~A lithe Twi'lek dancer and singer, Lyn Me performed with the Max Rebo Band during the group's residence as Jabba the Hutt's house band. From the stage, Lyn Me got an up-close look at the depraved galactic underworld.~lyn-me-main-image_9c02fdc3.jpeg
54922efd952952f3125fed87~Lyra Erso~A geologist with an extensive knowledge of crystals, Lyra Erso helped her husband Galen with his work before he became involved with Orson Krennic's energy-enrichment project. Deeply suspicious of both Krennic and the Empire, Lyra believed in the Force and tried to share her faith with her daughter Jyn. When Krennic tracks the Ersos to Lah'mu, she risks everything to protect her family.~lyra-erso-main_41211399.jpeg
4fbfbc2730c52d0b4cdaa6b5~M5-BZ~Serving alongside the aged Jedi Master Tera Sinube with distinction that drew the attention of the Jedi Council, M5-BZ was called upon to serve the Republic as part of D-Squad, an all-droid special missions unit led by the gruff Colonel Meebur Gascon. To carry out the vital assignment of capturing a Separatist encryption module, Beezee had its cranial memory module gutted to allow room for a mobile command center that would house Gascon.~m5-bz_293053bd.jpeg
4fbc0481df5831973a5ea3f1~Mace Windu~A grim Jedi Master with an amethyst-bladed lightsaber, Mace Windu was the champion of the Jedi Order, with little tolerance for the failings of the Senate, the arguments of politicians, or the opinions of rebellious Jedi. As the Clone Wars intensified, Mace sensed the dark side of the Force at work, and knew the Jedi's enemies were plotting to destroy the Order and end its stewardship of the galaxy.~Mace-Windu_b35242e5.jpeg
52b094acaee55d72f6fc0add~Magaloof~A Leffingite from Almak, Magaloof was a speeder thief who crossed paths with Obi-Wan Kenobi while the Jedi clung to an assassin droid zipping across the busy skylanes of Coruscant. Magaloof had seen a lot of things since coming to Coruscant, but a Jedi clutching a droid kilometers above the ground was a new one even for him.~magaloof_aff3601f.jpeg
53285aa33c009ece5010b163~Major Brance~A communications officer at the Resistance base on D'Qar, Taslin Brance brought word of the First Order's raid on Jakku to Leia Organa.

54927fdffb0668c1e8776999~Major Capin Harinar~Capin Harinar is part of General Draven's Alliance Intelligence staff. But where officers such as Colonel Delto argue over the importance of information, Harinar concerns himself with physical objects.

4fbfbc29ecf4e6c822310fb7~Major Rigosso~A military officer loyal to Otua Blank of Quarzite, Major Rigosso was tasked with overseeing the safe delivery of a precious cargo to his lordship during the Clone Wars. Due to the inhospitable atmospheric pressure on the surface of Quarzite, the Belugan and Kage people lived in subterranean passages beneath the planet's crust.

To best protect Blank's delivery, Rigosso hired a team of elite bounty hunters to accompany him and the cargo.~major_rigosso_cb35cf35.jpeg

4fbfbc2c91e431c1642afce2~Mantu~A squat, hunched being with cold, clammy skin and a murderous twinkle in his eye, Mantu was far from a typical Selkath. Historically, his people had been regarded as a peaceful, helpful culture devoted to the tending of the ill, or the care of their oceans. How far had the Selkath fallen that Mantu was one of their most well known modern legends, a deadly bounty hunter who relied on surprise to target his prey.~mantu_09633588.jpeg
520723565d2360bf41ea0612~Mar Tuuk~The Neimodian Mar Tuuk was a brilliant military strategist who hailed from planet Neimoidia. Tuuk was Captain of a droid control ship in the Separatist Fleet and oversaw the blockade of Ryloth during the Clone Wars. He matched wits against Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and was outmatched enough that he was forced to abandon his ship.~mar-tuuk_f6186b0c.jpeg
511ae0fab8bd11a8166e1c9e~Marrok~A loyal and well-trained anooba, Marrok was the Kyuzo bounty hunter Embo's faithful companion, assisting his master in a number of adventures. During a skirmish on Nal Hutta, the fearless Marrok saved the hunter Sugi from the clutches of Darth Maul. Embo waded into combat confident that Marrok would be at his side -- and would even retrieve the trusty hat the Kyuzo used as both weapon and shield.~image_a866ee0e.jpeg
5419803a8857059ed368aa09~Mart Mattin~Leader of Iron Squadron and captain of Sato's Hammer, Mart Mattin was a creative, if somewhat reckless, young rebel. When the Empire invaded his homeworld, Mykapo, he initially refused to leave, even though his ship had a broken hyperdrive. Eventually, Mart and Iron Squadron joined forces with the Ghost crew, handing the Empire a defeat and escaping to fight another day. He was reunited with his uncle, the famed Commander Sato, and his friends.~mart-mattin_e487433b.jpeg
4fbfbc2f60c4172e9a83f025~Mas Amedda~Mas Amedda was the Vice Chair of the Galactic Senate during Chancellor Valorum's term, a position he continued to hold as Chancellor Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Amedda's booming voice often called for order when the partisan nature of the Republic's government degenerated into pointless bickering. In an alien gesture of authority, he would often punctuate such calls with a flicker of his long, forked tongue.~mas-amedda-main-image_756fa0ae.jpeg
566276a406442b1103cfa1af~Master Codebreaker~He's a soldier, freedom fighter, ace pilot, top smuggler and a poet with a blaster - and a slicer capable of defeating the toughest security in the galaxy. So Maz Kanata describes the man known only as the Master Codebreaker. His favorite haunt is Canto Bight, where he's recognizable by the red plom bloom adorning one immaculate lapel of his tuxedo.~last-jedi-databank-master-codebreaker-main-image_4387c376.jpeg
51a7494dc93ea88a44cf6f21~Mawhonic~A Gran podracer, Mawhonic competed in the Boonta Eve Classic. Knowledgable podracing fans regarded him as one of the more capable challengers to Sebulba, the favorite in the hard-fought race.

50a99b0687fc1b62ad26eed4~Max Rebo~Max Rebo was the heart (or at least the fluid sac) of the band that bore his name, and could be found onstage behind the pedals of his red ball organ. From there he kept an ear on his bandmates' playing and an eye on the sleazy clients who hired his ensemble for their entertainment.~Max-Rebo_d4a6e06b.jpeg
527219a949b294fe68f78e36~Maz Kanata~Maz Kanata is more than a thousand years old, a diminutive being with vast experience at surviving in the underworld. From her castle on Takodana, Maz has seen galactic powers rise and fall and felt the Force ebb and flow, seeking an elusive balance between darkness and light. She has given many a young smuggler a start by offering credits, equipment or connections, and helped many an old friend rediscover a lost path.~maz-kanata_4c91003e.jpeg
51ee08f4eec9e816b7d20dab~ME-8D9~An ancient protocol droid of unknown manufacture, ME-8D9 has been a fixture at Maz's castle on Takodana for many years. Pirates and smugglers often ask Emmie to serve as a translator for their shady negotiations. The droid has been reprogrammed numerous times, and her original purpose is unclear. She's known to have served as an assassin, and some whisper that she began her long mechanical life with the Jedi Order.~me-8d9_d474afdc.jpeg
520726c93e1e32e5148ef952~Mee Deechi~Mee Deechi served as the war-loving Senator from Umbara during the Clone Wars. His white hair, gaunt face, pale complexion, and black-rimmed eyes cut a striking and intimidating figure.

4fbfbc32a8c1ad0b4cdaa6b5~Meena Tills~The watery world of Mon Cala was the site of a civil war during the Clone Wars, as the Mon Calamari people sided with the Republic, while the Quarren were backed by the Separatist Alliance. Senator Meena Tills was caught in the midst of this conflict, advising where she could while under the protection of the Jedi and clone troopers.     Later, Senator Tills was part of the Delegation of 2,000 -- Senatorial representatives concerned with the manner in which Chancellor Palpatine had waged the Clone Wars. The Petition of 2,000 identified Senators formally complaining on Palpatine's conduct, and requested that he return his emergency powers to the Senate following the resolution of the conflict.~meenatills_01_169_34912fb1.jpeg
53d6ce1aec001e424d7bf007~Melch~Melch was one of several enslaved Ugnaughts forced to work at Reklam Station, an Imperial salvage yard.

4fbfbc36908e8d0b4cdaa6b5~Mina Bonteri~A Senator of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Mina Bonteri had been a friend to Padmé Amidala, serving as her mentor on Naboo. Padmé missed her friend dearly, but contact between the Separatist and Republic governments was illegal during the Clone Wars. Nonetheless, Padmé secretly voyaged to Raxus, where she developed a peace accord with Mina. Bonteri proposed the peace overture to the Separatist government, finding support. The corporate barons secretly profiting the war did not agree, however. Mina died under mysterious circumstances, and her peace effort died as well.~minabonteri_01_169_14df3969.jpeg
50551a055453e473ad6897ef~Minister Maketh Tua~Minister Maketh Tua was a proud member of the Empire. With the rise of the Lothal rebels, Minister Tua gained the ire of Grand Moff Tarkin. Darth Vader and Agent Kallus informed her that she would meet with the Imperial leader, and Tua knew her life was in danger. She secretly contacted the Ghost team, looking for safe passage off Lothal in return for the Empire's secrets. While they were wary, the rebels agreed and set a rendezvous point. It was not to be, however; Darth Vader knew that Tua would try and escape, and used it to his advantage. After she boarded her shuttle and the rebels neared to escort the Minister, the ship exploded. It was all a setup meant to draw out and frame the rebels. Tua was killed, a tool used for Vader's evil machinations.~image_c1bfbb83.jpeg
52681827e20fde874a04e951~Mira Bridger~Mira Bridger lived on Lothal, a peaceful world, with her husband Ephraim and son Ezra…until the age of the Empire. Along with her husband, she would not bow to their tyranny. The Empire arrested the Bridgers, leaving Mira's son an orphan and separating the family for years. Sadly, they would never reunite; she and Ephraim died leading a jailbreak, giving up their own lives to free their fellow prisoners.~mira-bridger_2b5ea7de.jpeg
4fbfbc3a1ec57f1f9f756a65~Mister Borkus~A heavyset, barrel-chested Sullustan, Mister Borkus is the proprietor of a no-frills diner in Pons Ora, a small settlement on the mostly unknown world of Abafar. The opportunistic Borkus stumbled upon a clone commando suffering from amnesia. The soldier had escaped a devastating battle, and was stripped of his memory and his identity. Borkus callously took the clone -- Gregor -- under his care, never revealing his origin to the grateful survivor. Borkus "generously" offered to give Gregor room and board, at an expense, and also employed him as a dishwasher. But Gregor's meager wage wasn't enough to pay for his necessities, and thus the lowly dishwasher was little more than Borkus's slave.~misterborkus_01_169_546f6523.jpeg
4fbfb7f3d504f72e9a83f025~Moff Jerjerrod~A chilly technocrat, Tiaan Jerjerrod was responsible for overseeing construction of the second Death Star above the forest moon of Endor. The task was difficult, to say the least -- Jerjerrod desperately needed more time and more resources. What he got instead was a visit from Darth Vader.~commanderjerjerrod_01_169_3e457b94.jpeg
56ce7324ec57099612d22540~Moloch~A White Worm enforcer, Moloch ensures none of Lady Proxima's scrumrats works against the Grindalid matriarch.

4fbfbc3d5991572e9a83f025~Mon Mothma~A leader of the Galactic Senate's Loyalist faction, Mon Mothma opposed Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's policies during the final days of the Repulic.

505a488ada7dba29c81ebf61~Morad Sumar~Morad Sumar was a farmer from Kothar, Lothal, who would often sell his produce in the local marketplace.

4fbfbc63d69fa1c1642afce2~Moralo Eval~Conniving even for Phindian standards, Moralo Eval earned a loathsome reputation as a heartless murderer at a young age. As a boy, he killed his mother, telling authorities he did it because he was "bored." A lifetime spent as a criminal and a fugitive gave Eval a sharp survival instinct, and he had impressive technical and engineering skills. Life on the run may have also left him deranged; Moralo's odd mannerisms included talking about himself in the third person. During the Clone Wars, reports surfaced that Moralo was working with Count Dooku, possibly plotting to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine.~moraloeval_01_169_8bffd942.jpeg
4fbfbc66522c4ec9a549844d~Morley~Morley believed in self-preservation. As a serpentine Anacondan eking out a life on the junk planet of Lotho Minor, Morley needed cunning to survive. He would do anything to survive, including cutting a deal with a devilish outcast.

4fbfbc68ab460ec9a549844d~Mother Talzin~Mother Talzin, the spiritual guide of Dathomir's Nightsisters during the Clone Wars, held enormous power on her homeworld and wielded the strange magicks of the Nightsisters. She sold the services of the Nightsisters to the galaxy's wealthy and powerful, but wasn't above backstabbing any clients who treated her clan with disrespect. She sought revenge against Count Dooku and his master, Darth Sidious. Dooku had betrayed the Nightsister Asajj Ventress, but his crimes paled in comparison with Sidious's. Long before the Clone Wars, Sidious had promised to make Talzin his right hand, only to renege on his promise and steal her son, Darth Maul, to train as his apprentice.~mothertalzin_01_169_50fa6fd0.jpeg
549501cfa8f9d28f9d85a9d6~Nail~A gruff alien woman, Nail is Jyn Erso's cellmate in Wobani's grim LEG-817 labor camp.

51183695ff2fa38d87591169~Nala Se~As Kamino's chief medical scientist, Nala Se played a key role in engineering the Grand Army of the Republic - and worked to protect the army's secrets. She cared for clones injured on the battlefield, supervising their rehabilitation even when Separatist attacks threatened her own life as well as the lives of soldiers. But she had a ruthless side as well, insisting to Jedi General Shaak Ti that the clones were Kaminoan property to be disposed of as their creators saw fit. Nala Se knew of the bio-chips implanted in the clones to ensure that they obeyed protocols such as Order 66. Obeying the orders of Count Dooku - whom she knew as Lord Tyranus - she sought to keep these implants secret from the Jedi.~image_2d1e7c14.jpeg

While Arann's death remains a puzzle, some signs point to Nhego and Arran's past partnership in a large smuggling operation. Nhego is a dark and brooding individual, and often hard to track down. His interests lie mostly in personal acquisition of power and credits, but is sometimes found provoking small forces of the Rebel Alliance or the Empire into battle, or attempting to manipulate Kada into joining him.~nhego_background_cc63d235.jpeg
4fbfbc6b11c8cc541cb163cf~Nien Nunb~A native of Sullust, Nien Nunb was a smuggler who fought for both the Rebel Alliance and the Resistance during his long career.

4fbfbc6ddb0e5d0b4cdaa6b5~Nossor Ri~The chieftain of the Quarren people on Mon Cala, Nossor Ri was a friend to Mon Calamari King Yos Kolina, despite their clashing viewpoints. He was saddened by the shocking murder of the king, but could not support the rise of Prince Lee-Char, heir to the throne. Nossor believed Lee-Char was too young and inexperienced to lead the planet. Goaded by a Separatist "adviser," Riff Tamson, Nossor Ri called for new leadership, and a chance for a Quarren to hold the throne. The Quarren chieftain would come to regret siding with Tamson and the Separatists.~nossorri_01_169_5bad1ecb.jpeg

4fbfbc74d13a51c1642afce2~Nute Gunray~Neimoidians are known for their business skills, but Nute Gunray, Viceroy of the Trade Federation, was more cutthroat than most. It was Gunray who conspired with the Sith Lord Darth Sidious to launch the blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Once the planet was under siege, Gunray attempted to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty that would legitimize the occupation. Amidala escaped, and returned to infiltrate her own palace and blast through Gunray's protectors. Arrested by Republic officials, Gunray was carted off to answer for his crimes, but evaded imprisonment and kept his post.~nutegunray_01_169_9d66ded2.jpeg

56fba03c904e57af6f0acd06~Officer Sharest~Lead Transport Security Officer Falthina Sharest works at Coronet Spaceport, where she has seen her workday expand without a corresponding increase in pay.

4fbfbc9f94fe4d0b4cdaa6b5~Okalin~Okalin, advisor to the throne of Onderon, carefully monitored the unrest on the divided planet. With a network of contacts spread throughout the walled city of Iziz, Okalin was able to stay abreast of the shifting tides of fears and sympathy that gripped the Onderonian citizens during the Clone Wars.

4fbfbca22be23f1f9f756a65~Old Daka~The oldest and wisest of the Nightsisters clan, Old Daka's knowledge of the arcane magicks was unprecedented. When the Separatists launched a devastating attack on Dathomir, and the Nightsisters were outnumbered by General Grievous's droid forces, Mother Talzin retreated into the depths of the witches' lair and called upon Old Daka for help. Daka used an ancient incantation to summon the dead from the Nightsisters' graveyard, bolstering their number with zombie hordes.~olddaka_01_169_ae6b143e.jpeg

506f9af943ecd9b585c2f06a~Oleg~Nazhros Oleg was a caustic cadet at Lothal's Imperial Academy who never missed a chance to undermine his comrades, seizing every advantage in assessment tests and behaving selfishly on training missions. After Jai Kell stunned Oleg while escaping the academy with an undercover Ezra Bridger, Oleg suspected Zare Leonis had played a role in their escape. Oleg tried to push Zare into revealing his secret while relishing training missions that let him bully and interrogate Lothal citizens. One mission revealed an operation transporting black-market goods on Lothal, but the cadet didn't know his uncles were involved in this illegal trade. This revelation led to Oleg's dismissal from the academy.~image_64afa8dc.jpeg
4fbfbca47acd972e9a83f025~Onaconda Farr~The Senator from Rodia, Onaconda Farr had long been a friend and ally to Padmé Amidala.

4fbfbca6fc1fc4821c3c0271~Onca~Together with his brother Bulduga, Onca was part of a legendary bounty hunting team. While Bulduga fancied himself a fast-drawing gunslinger, Onca was slower, unable to overcome the bulk of his Ithorian build to snap off shots as quickly as his brother could.

Pablo's pawnshop proudly boasted all sorts of deadly gear. Based out of the Bilbousa Bazaar, Pablo kept a well-stocked shop reputed to have everything a bounty hunter might need. The shifty Rodian spoke in a sycophantic whisper, always careful not to upset his potentially murderous clientele. His connection to the Hutts and his ability to keep his store well-stocked is what kept the slimy trader alive and intact. If threatened, the spineless Rodian always backed down, much to the consternation of his Twi'lek partner, who worried for his safety.~pablo_83f15a96.jpeg

He was a young boy during the Clone Wars, when the Jedi Knights were overextended fighting in the galactic conflict to protect the Republic.

4fbaa988eafd74821c3c0271~Rancor~Rancors are towering hulks of muscle and reptilian flesh that walk on two stubby legs and use their disproportionately long arms to capture prey. A salivating, tooth-filled maw dominates their flat faces, and their armored skin is so tough that they can shrug off blaster bolts as little more than annoyances. While not inherently vicious - Felucia's farmers co-existed relatively peaceably with spined, brightly colored jungle rancors - these creatures were prized as trophies by crimelords and other wealthy, amoral individuals. Jabba the Hutt kept a rancor in a shadowy chamber beneath his Tatooine throne room. After Luke Skywalker killed the beast, an outraged Jabba ordered the public execution of the Jedi and his friends.~rancor_01_169_251b682f.jpeg

4fbfbd4607eed1c1642afce2~Ratts Tyerell~Ratts Tyerell was the tiniest of the Podracer pilots in the Boonta Eve Classic, though size matters not in such a competition. The little scrapper piloted a Podracer with immense engines ... too big, it would seem, for the tight confines of the Laguna Caves. On the second lap of the race, Ratts' accelerator jammed, and he couldn't get clearance past the rocky stalactites. The resulting fireball killed the little guy. His family, who had traveled to Mos Espa to witness the race, was reportedly seen grieving shortly thereafter.~rattstyerell_01_169_031aea6d.jpeg

4fbfbd7e7d5a74821c3c0271~Russo-ISC~Jedi investigators relied on their intuition and connection to the Force to solve most mysteries, but during the waning days of the Republic, this proved alarmingly difficult as the pall of the dark side began to cloud their perceptions. Increasingly, they turned to technological resources available in the Jedi Temple. Russo-ISC was one of many analysis droids employed by the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He led a team of analysis droids who were plugged into the sensor and security networks of the Temple.

Not as boisterous or as outspoken as her brother, Steela was nonetheless firmly dedicated to the cause of Onderonian independence. She was not one for impassioned speeches or political rhetoric. These were not her areas of expertise, and she felt far more comfortable peering through the macroscope of her blaster rifle. A crack shot, Steela racked up an impressive number of droid kills with precise headshots fired from the cover of canopy jungle.~steelagerrera_01_169_ea721e06.jpeg

4fbfbdf65432eb95e98e2e55~Tan Divo~As a police lieutenant in the Coruscant Security Force during the Clone Wars,  Lieutenant Tan Divo has a low-rate of success in his investigations, yet displays the pompousness and self-importance of someone who always gets his criminal in the end.

4fbfb947d624e72e9a83f025~Wat Tambor~The foreman of the Techno Union, Wat Tambor was one of the original and most fervent Separatist leaders, pledging his loyalty and his battle droid armies to Count Dooku at a pivotal meeting on Geonosis. Later in the war, Tambor was appointed emir of Ryloth. His occupation was a cruel one, in which Tambor stripped the Twi'leks of whatever valuables he could find, then bombed their villages.~emirwattambor_01_169_9528ba0f.jpeg
4fbfbe6b1cc4972e9a83f025~Watto~Watto was a Toydarian junk dealer in Mos Espa who bought Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin from Gardulla the Hutt. An inveterate gambler, he sponsored Anakin in several Podraces, but often bet against his own slave, who was talented but inexperienced.    Watto lost Anakin to Qui-Gon Jinn in a wager on the Boonta Eve race. Years later, he sold Shmi to the moisture farmer Cliegg Lars.~watto_01_169_ecd563f1.jpeg
4fbfbe7233ed5b95e98e2e55~Wedge Antilles~A talented young rebel pilot from Corellia, Wedge Antilles survived the attack on the first Death Star to become a respected veteran of Rogue Squadron. He piloted a snowspeeder in the defense of Echo Base on Hoth, and led Red Squadron in the rebel attack on the second Death Star above Endor.~wedgeantilles_01_169_b8185dce.jpeg
54928c0b956f71c8aca63b7e~Weeteef Cyu-Bee~A diminutive Talpini, Weeteef is a valuable member of Saw's band of partisans. His small size makes him ideal for infiltration missions in Jedha's Holy City, and he's both an expert sharpshooter and a clever builder of sticky bombs used to bring down Imperial scout walkers and assault tanks.~weeteef-cyu-bee-main_671488b4.jpeg
51adef51f284b03cd111fb17~Wes Janson~A native of Taanab, Wes Janson joined the Alliance and was assigned to Hoth's Echo Base. During the Battle of Hoth, Lieutenant Janson served as tail gunner for Wedge Antilles under the call sign Rogue Three. After the AT-AT walkers' armor proved too strong for blasters, Janson and Antilles were the first pilots to try Luke Skywalker's risky strategy of using harpoons and tow cables to trip up the Imperial war machines.~wes-janson_e193b62f.jpeg
4fbfbe9c007a1f1f9f756a65~Wicket W. Warrick~Wicket W. Warrick was the brave young Ewok who willingly joined the Rebellion and aided in the battle against the Empire on the forest moon of Endor. Even before he encountered the Rebels, Wicket had devised methods for defeating the Imperial machines, plans which were implemented after the Ewok befriended Princess Leia and recruited his tribe to the Alliance's cause. During the Battle of Endor, Wicket fought valiantly alongside his new allies.~wickettwwarrick_01_169_86d1210c.jpeg
518e967997d85582f2aa3ac2~Willie (W1-LE)~W1-LE was Lando Calrissian's personal attendant droid. Even with a laid-back personality, it handled all of Lando's business, particularly in his absence. Lando owned W1-1E since the Clone Wars; the droid once had a different body type, but Lando transferred its logic unit to an RQ unit. When the Lothal rebels made a deal with Calrissian for safe passage off the planet, W1-LE completed the transaction in Lando's stead.~willie-droid-main-image_fbc9d63c.jpeg
5310746a28e5a64c85093c0a~Wollivan~A vac-suit-clad Blarina, Wollivan is an interstellar scout, blazing new hyperspace trails between the galaxy's far-flung stars. A common sight in Maz's castle, he could often be found selling navigational data and trinkets - or sometimes gambling them away -- to fellow castle guests.~wollivan_0c371500.jpeg
514b8dc65c93b10eec0b7224~Wrecker (Bad Batch)~The bruiser of Clone Force 99, a group of elite Republic soldiers, Wrecker was strong enough to lift a clone gunship. Wrecker's strength and size were matched only by his temper, which could boil over easily, and was bad news for friend or foe alike.~Wrecker_18e418bf.jpeg
51855f8bb5a5cacff1662ecf~Wuher~You didn't survive in the Mos Eisley Cantina by being nice, and Wuher was a survivor. The gruff bartender dispensed drinks to the spacers, moisture farmers and barflies escaping the Tatooine heat; did his best to enforce the seedy bar's handful of rules (no droids and no settling fights with blasters); and avoided trouble, whether it began with trigger-happy patrons or stormtroopers investigating the latest incident.~wuher-main-image_883bdea2.jpeg
4fbab6a2ba776c9c67aa0b87~Wullf Yularen~An admiral in the Republic's service, Yularen served gallantly in the Clone Wars, commanding a Jedi Cruiser in many campaigns against Separatist forces. Yularen was assigned to serve with the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, and the rigid officer and the impulsive Jedi made for an odd combination. Yularen admired Anakin's bravery and instincts in battle while deploring his recklessness and willingness to interpret orders creatively -- or ignore them altogether.~admiralwulffyularen_01_169_b3e1285c.jpeg
50475a4925fd4c9dcc9bad3b~Wullffwarro~Wullffwarro was a Wookiee warrior that once fought for the Old Republic, and later forced into slavery by the Empire at the spice mines of Kessel.

51c7f6214491066395d3d6d5~Yarael Poof~A gaunt, long-necked Quermian, Yarael Poof had two brains and four arms, which he kept hidden beneath his Jedi robes.

5193458c7c9750dc65542133~Yarna d'al' Gargan~One of Jabba's many possessions, the ample Yarna d'al' Gargan served the Hutt as a dancing girl. Yarna's slower, more deliberate moves across the throne room floor formed a contrast to those of the slimmer, younger Oola.~yarna-main-image_d95b36c6.jpeg
4fbbd71efa926ef08582f452~Yoda~Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master and stronger than most in his connection with the Force.

505a4a27ad9f538660fb61d8~Yogar Lyste~Yogar Lyste was an Imperial officer stationed on Lothal.

52b7359b013d51a4ca044b0b~Yushyn~In league with the Empire, Yushyn operated a Mining Guild facility on a planetoid in the far reaches of space. He harvested a specific type of gas, which also attracted the massive purrgil creatures, and Yushyn coldly ordered his men to kill any beast that approached his refinery. Fate would bring the Ghost crew to his outpost, too, however. The rebels stole Yushyn's fuel and saved the purrgil; in turn, one of the great animals grabbed Yushyn in its jaws and dragged him into the planetoid's depths.~yushyn_1591ca15.jpeg
525c791e64121e8bd2db16a7~Zam Wesell~A shape-shifting Clawdite assassin from Zolan, Zam Wesell could assume any humanoid form. Jango Fett hired her to kill Padmé Amidala on Coruscant, but the Naboo Senator eluded an explosive that destroyed her starship, then escaped poisonous kouhuns let loose in her apartment.

506f9d052c0ff674cae8ed63~Zare Leonis~Zare Leonis found a kindred spirit in Ezra Bridger, as both were undercover cadets at the Imperial Academy with no love of the Empire. Zare showed impressive skill as a cadet, but his true goal was to find out what happened to his sister, Dhara -- a star trainee at the Imperial Academy who mysteriously vanished. Zare helped Ezra uncover an Imperial decoder and escape the academy, but remained behind as a spy.~image_7e9fc014.jpeg
4fbfbea0afb42d1d33fa85c5~Zatt~A bright Nautolan boy, Zatt was a Jedi youngling during the thick of the Clone Wars. With the Jedi Order spread thin during the galactic conflict, the training of the next generation of Jedi Knights was of priority, and Zatt underwent an important rite of passage supervised by Jedi Master Yoda and Padawan Ahsoka Tano. On the frozen world of Ilum, Zatt had to seek out his lightsaber crystal -- as per the tradition of The Gathering. Zatt had to learn to put aside his love of technology -- and the sensor unit he constantly fiddled with -- and rely on his own instincts to complete his quest.~zatt_01_169_046bf55f.jpeg
51934a23f3d95e711dcf9d49~Zett Jukassa~A young Padawan, Zett Jukassa fought heroically after clone troopers marched on the Jedi Temple to carry out Order 66. He fell in battle as a horrified Bail Organa looked on.~zett-jukassa_0eb7f414.jpeg

4fbfbea5eb0a3d1d33fa85c5~Zillo Beast~An ancient creature accidentally unearthed on Malastare during an intense battle of the Clone Wars, the Zillo Beast was a monster of legend. The enormous animal proved to be nearly invulnerable to Republic weaponry, prompting intense interest from Chancellor Palpatine. At his order, the creature was incapacitated and transported to a supposedly secure research facility on Coruscant. The Zillo Beast would not be caged, however, and it broke free from its restraints, running wild through the crowded thoroughfares of the capital, leaving swaths of destruction in the wake of its titanic rampage.~zillobeast_01_169_7ef368d8.jpeg
4fbfbea8beae552ac01bb488~Ziro the Hutt~Jabba the Hutt's Uncle Ziro conspired with Count Dooku to kidnap Jabba's son Rotta, reasoning that when the Jedi sent to retrieve Rotta died, the Republic would be forced to apprehend Jabba, leading to Ziro gaining control of their clan.    When the conspiracy unraveled, Ziro was imprisoned on Coruscant. Cad Bane freed him and turned him over to the Hutt Council, who feared that Ziro might tell the Republic of their many dirty dealings. Ziro escaped the Hutts, but could not outrun his past.~ziro_the_hutt_79826012.jpeg
4fbfbeab8a4b9cf90453278f~Ziton Moj~His gruff demeanor and devilish grin indicated Ziton Moj relished how well-protected he was by the power of criminal influence. A bully to his very marrow, Moj was a leg-breaking lieutenant for the Black Sun criminal syndicate during the Clone Wars. Never one to be intimidated, he was also pragmatic enough to avoid fights he couldn't win. This level-headedness served him well when Darth Maul usurped control of Black Sun, and installed Ziton as leader, replacing the decapitated ruling council.~zitonmoj_01_169_6cb70837.jpeg
5193416c60cfda583c41d8a6~Zuckuss~A Gand bounty hunter, Zuckuss heeded the Empire's call for mercenaries to locate the Millennium Falcon and bring her fugitive crew to justice, receiving his orders on the bridge of Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer.~zuckuss-main-image_af4f3e42.jpeg
